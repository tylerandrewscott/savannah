B&V Project 164139 B&V File C-1.3 May 11, 2009  To: From: cc: Subject:  Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council Kristin Rowles, GWPPC and Steve Simpson, Black & Veatch Tim Cash, Assistant Branch Chief, GA EPD Meeting Summary: Council Meeting on May 6, 2009  The council meeting was held on May 6, 2009, at the Mitchell EMC headquarters in Camilla. The list of attendees is attached. Steve Simpson, planning consultant project manager, briefly introduced the planning consultant team. Welcome and Introductions / Approve Agenda Council member John Bridges gave an invocation. Afterwards, Council member Doyle Medders welcomed the council to the Mitchell County EMC. Kristin Rowles, planning consultant facilitator, asked the Council to introduce themselves. Next, Kristin asked state agency members in attendance to introduce themselves. Then, Kristin asked members of the general public to introduce themselves. Kristin then reviewed the agenda which included:     Understanding our commitments and obligations How we will move forward: the planning process and timelines The story of water in our region: Trends, forces, and factors influencing the future of water Governance: Who will lead?  Kristin suggested that agenda be changed to cover the planning process material earlier in the day, and the Council members agreed. Election of Chair and Vice-Chair Kristin opened the floor for nominations for Chair. Richard Royal was nominated for Chair. Several council members stated that they did not want a secret ballot system, so eligible Council members voted by a show of hands. Richard Royal was elected Chair (22 votes). Next, nominations were taken for Vice Chair. Hal Haddock was the only nomination. He was elected Vice-Chair (21 Votes). Richard Royal thanked the Council.  MEETING SUMMARY Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council Council Meeting 1 Meeting Date: May 6, 2009 Recap Water Planning Councils Kickoff Meeting  Page 2 B&V Project 164139 May 11, 2009  Kristin briefly reviewed the Kickoff Meeting and asked the Council if they had any questions. The council members did not have any questions. What Needs to be Accomplished: Process, Timeline, and Report Outline Kristin gave an overview of the planning process and explained each of the components of the figure below and also discussed the timeline for the planning process.  Kristin asked if anyone had any questions. The following questions were asked:    Can the Council during the process tell EPD no? There was concern about having to sign a document at the end of the process if they did not agree with it. How will we work with other Councils? Kristin explained that this Council will be meeting other Councils, particularly neighboring Councils, and they always have the opportunity to attend other Council meetings. One Council member asked whether the population & employment forecasts would be made available for review by industrial water users. Tim Cash (GA EPD) said he didn't know, but that this was a good suggestion.  MEETING SUMMARY Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council Council Meeting 1 Meeting Date: May 6, 2009 MOA, Operating Procedures, and Rules for Meetings  Page 3 B&V Project 164139 May 11, 2009  The next section of the agenda dealt with the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), Operating Procedures and Rules for Meetings. Kristin noted that we would start with a presentation of the MOA by the Environmental Protection Division (EPD). She indicated that the MOA itself is largely derived from the existing statewide water planning rules and the statewide water plan, and therefore, not really open to change. However, the Operating Procedures and Rules for Meetings are open to discussion, and we would discuss them today, after the presentation. Tim Cash, Assistant Branch Chief for the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, outlined to the Council key roles and responsibilities for each of the parties in the MOA. The parties to the MOA are the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, the Georgia Department of Community Affairs, and the Council members. Tim emphasized that the MOA was not a contract, but an agreement to participate. Tim stated that EPD will be on the sidelines coaching the Council members through the process, and the first line of contact for the Council members is Black & Veatch and the Georgia Water Planning & Policy Center. Tim explained that the Operating Procedures and Rules for Meetings documents were designed to help guide the Councils through the water planning process. Tim stated that this segment of the agenda today would be spent identifying desired changes to the Operating Procedures and Rules for Meetings. Tim said that EPD would provide feedback on these suggested changes with the hope that the Council could finalize the documents and sign the MOA at the next Council meeting. After Tim's presentation, one Council member asked whether they could suggest other data sources. Tim responded that Council members could always suggest other data sources. Next, Kristin passed out a handout titled "Achieving Results through Consensus Decision Making" and explained since the definition of consensus is different for everyone. She explained that because the draft Operating Procedures emphasize the use of consensus decisionmaking, the council needed to discuss it and determine how it can be used by this group. She noted that this discussion would lay a foundation for considering the Operating Procedures and Rules for Meetings. She divided the council members into five groups to work through the handout. After the groups were finished, Kristin asked each group what they thought of the consensus process described in the worksheet. Could they use it? What were its advantages and disadvantages? A summary of the group reports follows:    Consensus may work, but most preferred Robert's Rules. Generally, they are familiar with Robert's Rules and believe it would save time. Two-thirds majority may be difficult to achieve.  MEETING SUMMARY  Page 4  Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council B&V Project 164139 Council Meeting 1 May 11, 2009 Meeting Date: May 6, 2009  Most would prefer simple majority for voting, but one group of Council members noted a preference for two-thirds majority. Next, Kristin separated the council members again into the same small groups and gave each group the "Operating Procedures/Rules for Meetings Broad Issue Areas" Small Group worksheet. The purpose of the worksheet was to encourage discussion on each section of the Operating Procedures and Rules for Meetings. The groups reported the following suggestions:  Under Quorum (Section VI, Operating Procedures), Council members recommended that a quorum be 17 members (e.g., 2/3 of 25 Council members). Alternates should be used if needed to attain a quorum. When an alternate is used to attain a quorum, all alternates present will be eligible to vote at that meeting. Under Other Meetings and Open Meetings (Section VI, Operating Procedures), Council members recommended issuing a press release to the media to announce Council meetings. They also asked for clarification of how public notice requirements apply to their meetings. All votes should be by simple majority. The Chair & Vice-Chair should be selected by a simple majority vote and serve at the pleasure of the Council. The last paragraph under Section IV of the Operating Procedures, "Selection of the Chair and Vice-Chair", should be deleted. There is an error with the last sentence of the Quorum definition in Section II of the Operating Procedures: the definition incorrectly refers to the Coosa-North Georgia Water Planning Council. In Meeting Summaries (Section VI, Operating Procedures), Council members recommended that this section state that a draft meeting summary will be made available to the Council and the public prior to the next Council meeting. Under Regular Meetings (Section VI, Operating Procedures), Council members recommended that the Council should meet at least quarterly, or more frequently if needed and called by the Chair. In Subcommittees (Section VI, Operating Procedures), Council members recommend that subcommittees should have a minimum of five council members and that members should be appointed by the Chair. Under Amendments (Section VII, Operating Procedures) and Rules for Meetings (Section VI, Operating Procedures), Council members recommend that decision making on Amendments and Rules for Meetings should be by simple majority voting, not by consensus or two-thirds majority. For Meeting Summaries (Section VI, Operating Procedures), Council members asked for clarification on whether the meeting summaries could serve as official meeting minutes. Discussion followed, and it was generally agreed that the meeting summaries could take a form that would serve as minutes. The planning contractor could modify the format of the meeting summaries as needed to meet the Council's needs. Council members               MEETING SUMMARY  Page 5  Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council B&V Project 164139 Council Meeting 1 May 11, 2009 Meeting Date: May 6, 2009 suggested that the meeting summaries include sections to summarize discussion items and action items (including votes).  For Meeting Roles (Rules for Meetings, Rule 2(E)), the Council members would like for the Chair to be able to speak to the media on behalf of the Council, instead of having the EPD representative do so.  For Meeting agenda and summaries (Rules for Meetings, Rule 4(F&G)), Council members suggested deleting all but the 1st sentence of 4F and deleting 4G in its entirety. They do not see the need for a consent agenda in this process.  Under Decision Making (Rules for Meetings, Rules 6 F, G, I, & J, Council members recommended that all references to consensus decision making should be changed to reflect their preference for simple majority voting. Kristin facilitated discussion of the Council's suggestions. The suggestions, comments, and questions will be provided to EPD to seek feedback and clarification. Potential changes to address the concerns raised will be discussed at the next Council meeting. In addition, Council members had the following questions:    If a Council member resigns, how will they know to whom to send a resignation letter? (They were not notified of who made their appointment.) Do elected officials need to resign if they are not elected during their tenure? Is there a time when a Council might need to go into Executive Session?  The Chair recommended that the Council vote on their suggested changes in order to reflect the level of support for these suggestions. A series of votes on the suggested changes was held, and all votes were unanimously in favor of the following suggested changes:        The Council prefers to operate by Robert's Rule and simple majority voting. The Chair & Vice-Chair should be selected by a simple majority vote and serve at the pleasure of the Council. The last paragraph under Section IV of the Operating Procedures, "Selection of the Chair and Vice-Chair", should be deleted. Notice of Council meetings should be by press release to the media. Seek further clarification of public notice requirements for the Council. The Meeting Summaries paragraph (Section VI, Operating Procedures) should state that a draft meeting summary will be made available to the Council and the public prior to the next Council meeting. The Regular Meetings paragraph (Section VI, Operating Procedures) should state that the Council should meet at least quarterly, or more frequently, if needed and called by the Chair. The Quorum paragraph (Section VI, Operating Procedures) should state that a quorum is 17 members (e.g., 2/3 of 25 Council Members). Alternates should be used if needed to  MEETING SUMMARY  Page 6  Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council B&V Project 164139 Council Meeting 1 May 11, 2009 Meeting Date: May 6, 2009 attain a quorum. When an alternate is used to attain a quorum, all alternates present will be eligible to vote at that meeting.  The Subcommittees paragraph (Section VI, Operating Procedures) should state that each subcommittee will have a minimum of five Council members and that members will be appointed by the Chair.  In the Rules for Meetings paragraph (Section VI, Operating Procedures) and in the Amendments Section (Section VII, Operating Procedures), decision making should be by simple majority voting, not by consensus or two-thirds majority.  For the Meeting Summaries paragraph (Section VI, Operating Procedures), Council members would like to clarify that meeting summaries should be prepared to serve as meeting minutes. Additionally, meeting summaries should include sections that summarize discussion items and action items (including votes).  In Rule 2(E) (Rules for Meetings), Council members would like for the Chair to be the spokesperson for the Council to the media.  In the Rules for Meetings, in Rule 4(F), delete all but the first sentence of the rule. Delete Rule 4(G) in its entirety. (Rules for Meetings)  Under Decision Making, in Rules 6 F, G, I, & J, all references to consensus decision making should be changed to reflect the Council's preference for simple majority voting. (Rules for Meetings) Present Website Capabilities Robert Osborne, planning consultant team member, gave a presentation after lunch on the present website capabilities. He demonstrated how to find council information and other water planning resources at the Georgia water planning portal site http://www.georgiawaterplanning.org. Robert indicated that EPD would soon have a new site design which will make finding information easier. He showed a demonstration snapshot of this site. He noted that the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council will have its own website that will be accessible from the main portal site. The address for this site will be: http://www.FlintOchlockonee.org. Regional Geography, Facilities and Resources Overview Steve presented an overview of water resources in the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee region. Steve handed out a copy of Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Region's Resources Map to each council member. The presentation included a summary of the following:     Census and population breakdowns Wildlife resources Impaired Waters/ Total Maximum Daily Loads Power plants  MEETING SUMMARY Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council Council Meeting 1 Meeting Date: May 6, 2009  Permitted water use in the region  2005 Water withdrawal breakdowns for the region  Page 7 B&V Project 164139 May 11, 2009  Steve noted that a county by county breakdown of water use, NPDES permits, and storm water was included in the presentation, but in the interest of keeping on schedule, he would not review every county. Steve noted a copy of this presentation will be posted on the website along with other material from today's presentation.     The Council members had several questions about agricultural water use and meters: What is the status of the metering program for agriculture? How is the data being used? What does the data tell us about agricultural water use? Do all irrigation systems have meters installed?  These questions generated discussion among the Council members, planning contractors, and agency personnel. The Chair asked that the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission report to the Council on installation and collection of agricultural water withdrawal meter data. Trends, Forces, and Factors that will Affect the Future of Water in the Region / Implications of Trends for the Region and Regional Plan Kristin said that the next part of the agenda would focus on collecting information from the members and starting to build the foundation on which to develop a learning process. Kristin asked each person to generate some ideas on what are the trends, forces, and factors that will affect the future of water in our region. She asked them to include social, technological, economic, environmental, and political factors. Next, Kristin asked Council members to share their ideas, which were written on the flip charts for members to view. The ideas were then arranged in "clumps" by a small group of Council members. Then, Kristin worked with the entire Council to name and discuss the implications of each of the "clumps". The results were as follows: Increasing Economic Uncertainty  Economic uncertainty affects industrial water use  Subdivision development halted  Economic uncertainty affects agricultural water use Factors that Decrease Demand for Water  Decreasing industry  Increasing cost of supplying water (municipal)  MEETING SUMMARY Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council Council Meeting 1 Meeting Date: May 6, 2009 Political Pressure affecting Water Resource Management  Increasing political pressure to share water resources  Increasing pressure to build dam on the Flint River  Tri-State Water Wars Increasing use of water conservation  Increasing municipal water conservation  Shift from diesel to electric power use  Increased efforts to find water leaks in supply system  Localized restrictions on outdoor water use  State drought restrictions In-migration  Population migration (halfbacks) to Georgia Nature  Limitations on recharge in Flint  Climate variation Data good, need more  Better, but not enough water resources data  Page 8 B&V Project 164139 May 11, 2009  Regulatory Pressure  Nutrient limits on discharges in free flowing stream will make treatment more costly Water Quality  Trend toward identifying more impaired waters  Increase in factors endangering free flowing streams During the discussion of these "clumps", the group also noted the following important factors: · Critical importance of agriculture in the region · Opportunities offered by the region's resources · Lack of infrastructure for industry in some parts of region · Need to better understand/estimate consumptive use of water by agriculture With help from the Council, Kristin used the posted "clumps" and factors to develop a "story" for water in the region. In general, like many other places, the region currently faces substantial uncertainty due to economic conditions. Water conservation efforts are increasing, while the future demand for water seems difficult to predict based on recent trends. Increasing attention is being paid to water quality concerns in the region, and new regulatory pressures relating to water quality may develop. Information on water resources has improved in recent years, but better  MEETING SUMMARY  Page 9  Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council B&V Project 164139 Council Meeting 1 May 11, 2009 Meeting Date: May 6, 2009 information is still needed. Finally, political and natural factors place significant pressures and constraints on water resources management in this region. Introduction to Population and Employment Forecasts Kristin provided an introduction to the forthcoming population and employment forecasts. First, she provided an overview of population and employment trends in Georgia, and then she explained the methodology that is being used to forecast population and employment for the region. The population and employment forecasts will help to determine future water and wastewater needs for the region. The presentation slides will be available on the website. Kristin explained that the Population and Employment forecasts will soon be shared with local governments in the region, as well as Council members. With the population and employment forecasts, local governments will also receive an invitation to participate in the Local Government Advisory body for the Council. Kristin noted that the Council's roles with respect to the Population and Employment forecasts would be: (1) understand the background information and methods; (2) review the forecasts that they will receive later this month; (3) encourage local governments to submit comments; and (4) discuss the forecasts at the Council's next meeting (June). After the presentation, Kristin asked council members if they had any questions, and there were no questions. Local Elected Officials and Public Comments Next, local elected officials and the general public were provided an opportunity to address the Council. There were no elected officials who spoke. Two members of the general public spoke to the council. Charles Stripling highlighted the work of the Stripling Irrigation Research Park and the benefits to the farming community. Charles also highlighted the Flint Riverkeeper and urged the Council to consider Flint Riverkeeper input. Shana Udvardy, Water Program Manager of the Georgia Conservancy, mentioned that Charles Stripling was a board member of the Georgia Conservancy. She advised that the Georgia Conservancy has been part of the Georgia Water Coalition that started in 2004. Shana urged the council to consider public comment before taking action. Wrap-Up and What to Expect Next Meeting After considering several possible dates, it was agreed that Thursday, June 11, 2009, would be the date for the next Council meeting. Chris Hobby suggested that the meeting be held in  MEETING SUMMARY  Page 10  Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council B&V Project 164139 Council Meeting 1 May 11, 2009 Meeting Date: May 6, 2009 Bainbridge, possibly at the Firehouse Gallery. Kristin told the Council that she will confirm the location and get back with the Council members on meeting plan details.
