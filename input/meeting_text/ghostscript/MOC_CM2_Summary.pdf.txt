2) Agenda and Council Meeting 1 Minutes  Elmo  Richardson  presented  the  agenda  for  the  meeting  to  the  Council  for approval.    A motion 
and  second  were  made  to  adopt  the  agenda  without  modifications.    No  discussion  was forthcoming and the agenda was approved as presented.   
 David Ashley presented the meeting summary for Council Meeting 1.  A clarification was made 
to  the  statement  by  Adriane  Wood,  from  DCA,  that  the  agency  will  be  changing  the  dates  for Comprehensive Plan recertification by local governments.  The correct statement should be that  

2 
 

DCA will not be changing dates for Comprehensive Plan recertification, but will change dates as they expire based on outcome of Council plans. 
 Question 

\Gamma   Regarding  the  Regionally  Important  Resources  (RIR),  will  that  information  be available for this plan? 

Response  \Gamma   The RIR  identifies any  cultural,  historic,  and  natural  resources  that are of regional importance.  This report has been drafted by the Middle Georgia Regional Development Center, 
and a draft is available on their website, www.MGRDC.org, along with a map of the identified resources. 
 A request was made to add a list of council members who did not attend to the meeting minutes. 
 3) MOA, Operating Procedures and Rules for Meetings  
Kevin  Farrell  presented  the  proposed  changes  that  were  captured  and  submitted  to  EPD  for review.    EPD  then  evaluated  and  accepted  or  recommended  modifications.    For  the  Middle 
Ocmulgee  Council,  changes  were  basically accepted  with  some  minor rewording.   Council  can have further discussion on proposed changes, or can accept and sign. 
 Elmo  Richardson  requested  a  motion  to  approve  changes  and  incorporate  in  MOA.    A  motion 
and 2nd were made.  Discussion followed:   
Question  -  On  two-thirds  requirement  for  voting,  does  this  only  apply  to  chair  and  vice-chair election or to all decisions?   
Response \Gamma  Two-thirds is a consensus, but a simple majority would rule in a conflict.    
All Council Members agreed that the goal is to achieve a consensus in all decisions.    
The  MOA  was  PASSED  unanimously,  and  the  MOA  document  was  passed  around  for signatures.  Nineteen signatures were obtained during the meeting. 
 4) Planning Process Overview  

Farrell presented the Planning Process Overview presentation.  No questions were asked.  
5) Population and Employment Projections 
Ashley  presented  the  Population  and  Employment  Projections  presentation.    The  population

and will be the new official State forecasts.  They are to be finalized by mid-August. 
Question \Gamma  Why is there a sag in year 2040 in all the population graphs?   
Response \Gamma  That is a question to ask Dr. Brown when he joins in a conference call later in the morning.    All  comments  on  population  and  employment  forecasts  are  due  to  EPD  by  June  30, 

2009.  All local governments on the Georgia Municipal Association (GMA) and Association of County Commissioners of Georgia (ACCG) lists were sent the population data. 

Question\Gamma   Were  the  Regional  Development  Centers  (RDCs)  included  in  receiving  the population data?  

3 
 

Response \Gamma  Yes. 
Question  \Gamma   Can we ask  specific questions of  Dr. Brown? (e.g.  Butts  County  has  had  two 400-home subdivisions and the school board reports 500+ enrollment increase so far.) 

Response \Gamma  Please submit specific questions to info@georgiawaterplanning.org 
Comment \Gamma  Availability of water (e.g. excess availability at MWA Town Creek Reservoir) will promote  growth  in  some  areas  that  will  be  much  different  from  historical  patterns  of  growth.  

That needs to be considered as part of this planning process. 
Comment \Gamma  The excess capacity is really future capacity and it should include the availability in the plan. 

Question  \Gamma   What  is  the  difference  in  workforce  and population  in  the  future?   Are those folks unemployed? 
Question \Gamma  How was the population modified to account for the workforce differential? 
Question \Gamma  Concern is the current economic situation.  If economy was better, could add 5,000 people  very  shortly,  which  would  be  2030  for  Butts  County.   

\Delta \Theta \Lambda \Xi \Pi  \Pi \Sigma \Upsilon \Lambda \Phi  \Pi \Sigma \Psi \Omega \Psi  ff\Theta fffiflffi\Pi \Upsilon \Theta \Lambda projections are correct. 

Response \Gamma  All questions have been written down, and will be posed to those participating in the conference call. 
Conference Call with Drs. Warren Brown and Jeffrey Dorfman from CVIOG and David Tanner of OPB: 
A short break was held, following which, Warren Brown and Jeff Dorfman from CVIOG, as well as David Tanner of OPB joined the meeting by telephone conference call.   
David  Tanner  stated  that  the  State  of  Georgia  previously  did  all  projections  in-house  until  last year when they decided that more regular updates are needed and contracted with CVIOG. 
Warren Brown joined UGA in January 2009, from Cornell University.  He gave a more detailed overview of the process.  This process used trends from both the 1990s (between 1990 and 2000 
census)  and  since  2000,  and  was  based  on  models  developed  by  the  University  of  Texas-San Antonio. 

Jeff  Dorfman  explained  that  the  workforce  projections  were  developed  using  confidential  data from  the  Department  of  Labor  in  50  different  industry  classifications.    They  started  with  a 
statistical  model  that  included  recessions  and  expansions;  this  model  was  then  expanded  to include regional, state-wide and industry trends.   The model was adjusted to keep growth from 
getting  too  high  and  to  account  for  the  current  economic  situation  for  2008  to  2010.    Finally, adjustments  were  made  to  retail  employment  upward  in  the  far  future  to  match  population 
projections. 
Brown  and  Dorfman  were  asked  to  explain  the  alternative  projection  scenarios.    Scenario  1.0 indicated that the rate of net migration from the 1990s would continue through 2040, which was 

the  limit  of  University  of  Texas-San  Antonio  study.    The  2000  to  2007  Scenario  was  adjusted based on trends for the first seven years of 2000s.  Scenario 0.0 included no net migration, and 
was  more  for  analytical  purposes.    The  Scenario  0.5 used  half  the migration  rate from  1990  to 2000.  The workforce-adjusted scenario ties total population growth to jobs growth.  The dip is a 
function of  the  transition of  the  two time periods  that  needs  to  be  addressed.   There is  no  such precision as implied from this dip.

This  evaluation  is  completely  based  on  past  trends  and  does  not  consider  a  water  shortage  or other  major  limitations  to  growth.    That  needs  to  be  added  from  Councils/EPD/planning 
consultants. 
Process for input of local knowledge: Please complete forms provided and return to planning consultant and directly to CVIOG as well as regional planners for your community. 

Question \Gamma  Were RDCs involved?   
Response \Gamma  Yes, the RDCs were involved as reviewers.   
Question \Gamma  Have there been any communications issues or have all responded?   
Response \Gamma  Resources vary by region and available monies, but all RDCs have had some level of involvement. 

Question \Gamma  What is the differential between current and projected per capita employment ratios?  Unemployed?  
Response \Gamma  Major factor is aging of population and retired.  By 2030, many baby-boomers will retire and the population percentage over age 65 is quite large. 
Question \Gamma  How were regional projections developed?  Were they done, and then added together for state total, or was state total first then divided? 
Response \Gamma  Population was originally done at state and county levels, then added together to get regional numbers.  On employment, done on regional basis, because of confidentiality issues (i.e. 
one  large  employer  in  a  county),  then  adjusted  regional  population  based  on  jobs  ratio  and divided out to counties. 

Question \Gamma  How will population growth in neighboring states impact Georgia?   
Response  \Gamma   Not  only  do  sister  states  have  an  impact,  but  northern  states  have  been  basically exporting  people  for  a  long  time  and  are  running  out  of  folks  to  send.    Therefore,  our  rate  of 

migration  is  not  expected  to  continue  indefinitely.    That  has  not  explicitly  been  considered  in these projections, but needs to be included in the future. 

Question \Gamma  Butts County  currently has 1,200 permits outstanding, representing  a lot of people.  Several subdivisions  have  been  entirely foreclosed,  but  have  been  bought  recently  by  investors 
who  anticipate  turning  them  around.    Also,  some  people  have  moved  in  with  relatives  from neighboring  counties.    There  have  been  complaints  of  12  to  15  people  in  one  home.    There  is 
concern that the population forecasts for Butts County are significantly low. 
Response \Gamma  Outer counties with affordable housing have seen a significant drop in home values.  People can now buy homes closer-in which may significantly extend how long it takes to fill the 

1,200 permits. 
Question \Gamma  What is your timeline to finalize projections as related to water plan? 
Response \Gamma  CVIOG has asked for 30 days after delivery of all feedback materials to revise (mid July to mid August).  They should have final projections by the end of August. 

There will be workshops in the fall for input where more time will be spent on each issue.  It has not been determined how they will be publicized yet. 
 6) Agriculture Water Demand Forecasts 
David Ashley gave the Agricultural Water Demands presentation, following which; three

 7) Modeling 101 
Eric Nease presented the modeling introduction information.  Models are developed to simulate real-world systems 
Question \Gamma  Will the models be validated? 
Response \Gamma  Yes   

8) Resource Assessments 
David Ashley went over the resource assessment presentation. 
Question \Gamma  Are we concerned with water quality or only quantity?   
Response \Gamma  Both. 
Question \Gamma  Are individual counties responsible for cleaning up their streams?  \Delta \Theta \Lambda \Xi \Theta  \Pi eard of a requirement for local counties to clean up PCBs (Polychlorinated Biphenyl) by 2012.  

Response \Gamma  EPD is responsible for water quality, no requirement for local counties.  No knowledge of PCB requirement. 
Question \Gamma  Robbins Air Force Base (AFB) discharges to the Ocmulgee River.  In the past, there was some discussion on the construction of this discharge and there were metals present in the 
discharge.  Is the Department of Defense (DoD) exempt from NPDES permitting requirements? 
Response \Gamma  No, Robbins AFB has an NPDES discharge permit with limits.   
Follow up question \Gamma  Metal concentrations in stream may go up and down as flows change.  Response 

\Gamma  That is all considered in the permitting process.  They also have to do toxicity testing on an annual basis. 

 9) Creating a Regional Vision 
Charlotte Weber presented a continuation of the visioning process.   Members were asked to begin thinking about a vision for the Council and bring some thoughts and ideas to the next 
meeting.  The questions to help members craft their vision and goals will be sent to Council members in the week following this meeting.

 Response 

\Gamma  In addition to our meetings, there will be a joint meeting with the chairs and vice chairs in October.  As we move along in the process, additional joint meetings with other 

councils have also been planned.  
11) Local Elected Officials Comments  There were no comments by local elected officials.

Response \Gamma  Not an issue for this Council at this time; would be premature to raise it.  MNGWPD was created under a different legislation, and the Water Planning Councils have no regulatory 
authority.  Chairman Richardson expressed the viewpoint that the Council would not want to affect the decision about choices of qualified site design professionals; that should be a local 
government decision.  
13) Meeting Wrap-up  Calendars  for  September  2009  were  distributed  to  the  Council  to  aid  in  scheduling  the  next 
meeting.  EPD goal is to have the next meeting between September 8 and 18.  
Meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM.
