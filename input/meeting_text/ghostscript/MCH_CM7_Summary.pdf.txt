\Gamma   Funding  
\Gamma   Data needs and,  
\Gamma   Interbasin transfers.   

Council member Joe Maltese asked the council to consider adding instream flow. Chair Windom said he thought this was already included as a part of the funding data topic. 
Again, Matt reminded council members to submit topic ideas directly to Steve Simpson.  
Matt discussed the following calendar of events:

Council member Joe Maltese emphasized that the council would be really "shooting in the dark" without extending our deadline by a year so the Council could review the 
updated Army Corps of Engineers Revised Water Control Plan.  Joe Maltese made a motion to ask the General Assembly to extend the deadline by a year.  Jimmy Knight 
seconded this.  Matt asked the Council if there were any other comments. Council member Steve Davis agreed that by extending the milestone deadline that this increase 
our chances for more viable plan.

Meeting Date: September 14, 2010 
 Council member Robert Watkins asked the Council if they thought the Army Corps of 

Engineers would consider our plan in the development of their plan.  Joe Maltese said that he thought we would be able to inject comments only during the public comment 
portion of the update.  
Council member Paul Chappell said he agreed with trying to extend the deadline by twelve months.   
 Council member Jim Woods said it was the Council's responsibility to provide a good 
plan. He said if the plan becomes immediately invalid then the Council has wasted its time. Jimmy Knight also commented that we would be remised (remiss?)if we did not 
make comments to the revised Army Corps of Engineers Water Control Plan.  
Council member Gordon Moss asked Tim if he knew how much administrative cost would be involved if we had more time for this process.   
 When asked, Tim Cash responded to the Council's discussion regarding the time 
extension by asking them to consider the following:  

-  An extension would probably require more money, but we don't know how much, and would probably require appropriations by the General Assembly in a less than 

favorable budget climate; and  
-  There are nine other councils that would also probably get the extension which means this will be a continued statewide effort and not simply limited to one or two 

councils; and  
-  In response to the Council's discussion about waiting to finish their plan until after the Corps has issued its water control manual so that the Council could comment 

directly to the Corps on the water control manual, Tim reminded the Council that the primary responsibility of the Council, as embodied in the State Water Plan and the 
Memorandum of Agreement, is to recommend a Regional Water Development and Conservation Plan to the Director of EPD for approval; and 
 -  In response to comments that the Regional Water Development and Conservation 

Plan cannot be completed until the Water Control Manual and the lake and watershed model results are completed, Tim commented that it is unlikely that we will ever 
have enough information to answer every question in the first round and some of those questions will have to be answered in subsequent rounds and that until we have 
had resolution on the issue of whether an extension will be forthcoming, we should try to stay on track to write the best plan we can with the best information we have 
within the current schedule; and

 - 

The idea of an extension is being discussed at higher levels.  

  
There were no other comments and Matt asked the Council if they had reached consensus on asking EPD to extend their deadline.  There were no objections.   
 Matt asked the Council to approve the previous Council's meeting minutes.  Jimmy 
Knight made a motion to approve and Joe Maltese seconded the motion. They were approved unanimously. 
  
Draft WDCP Section 1-5   
Jim Hawkins reviewed the status of the WDCP Section 1-5 and said the Work Group provided clear instructions to describe the uncertainties, such as the 1989 Water Control 
Plan update, State of Alabama data, and thermoelectric demands.  He said they were also working to define the scenarios that would show what the world would look like in 2050. 
 Council member Joe Maltese said Scenario 5 with the Water Control Plan update is 
problematic for him.  Joe said he does not understand why we can't just talk about the future with Dr. Georgakakos's model. 
 Council member Steve Davis thought the Council needed move beyond Scenario 5 or at a 
minimum just point out the problems with Scenario 5. Matt Windom said he wasn't quite sure how the Council could not include Scenario 5.   
 Tim Cash reminded the Council that the Memorandum of Agreement between EPD and 
the council stated that council was to plan based on the resource assessments. Tim said the state plans (the 10 WDCPs) in the state need to be based on the same data for 
consistency.  
Joe Maltese said he was worried with this concept. Council member Jeff Lukken was worried that the Council has asked to sign off on a plan that will not be relevant next year 
following the issuance of a new Water Control Plan. Council member Bill Gregory reminded the council that not all councils have to deal with the federal lakes and other 
unique circumstances that this council has to deal with.  
Council member Ken Penuel asked if the Army Corps of Engineer was basing their revisions to their Water Control Plan on the same data that this council is using. Council 
member Joe Maltese said he is wrestling whether it is our plan or EPD's Plan. Joe

Meeting Date: September 14, 2010 
 Next, Jim reviewed water demand management practices include measures to conserve 

by reducing water use, water waste, and water loss. Several practices have been identified which could involve additional costs on local governments, industries, and individuals. 
These practices include:  

* Support implementation of Tier 1 and 2 conservation activities 23 of 36 * Require all water providers to implement conservation oriented rate structures 

* Encourage all water providers to implement education and outreach programs * Encourage local providers to prepare drought contingency plans 
 Wastewater return management practices decrease regional consumptive water use by 
increasing the quantity of treated wastewater effluent returned to surface waters. These practices also include water reuse. Returns practices could involve additional costs to 
utilities providing central sewerage, industries, and individuals.   
These practices include:  

* Encourage communities to decommission septic systems and connect to centralized treatment 

* Eliminate further land application system discharges for major (greater than 1 mgd) facilities 

* Encourage utility providers to determine potential opportunities and development of non-potable reuse 
 Water supply management practices include those which would augment existing water 
supply and water quality needs. These practices include:  

* Study the development of new surface water storage reservoirs * Implement new surface water storage as necessary 

* Encourage the use of farm ponds * Study the development of additional regional groundwater use 

* Encourage interconnection of regional supply systems  
An additional category of water quantity management practices aimed at enhancing the regions ability to meet instream water uses is considered. These practices include: 
 

\Gamma   Advocate for modification to the current operation of the federal reservoirs in the ACF basin by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 

 
\Gamma   Establish a new instream flow targets for protection of water quality past the Columbus node to maintain a daily average flow at or above 1,350 cubic feet per 

second.

Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council  B&V Project 164139 Council Meeting 7  September 20, 2010 
Meeting Date: September 14, 2010 
 

\Gamma   Prevent reservoir levels from dropping below critical levels to meet authorized recreational use in West Point Lake such that normal operation is maintained 

between 632.5 - 635 feet NVGD. Induced flood storage between elevation 635 - 641 feet NVGD will be utilized when needed. 
 
\Gamma   Modify the RIOP to allow the federal reservoir projects to recover more rapidly after drought conditions. 

 
\Gamma   Encourage the use of privately-owned storage in the ACF basin to meet the flow requirements below Woodruff Dam during drought periods, 

 
\Gamma   Study the scientific justification for requirement that greater than 5,000 cubic feet per second flows be maintained below Woodruff Dam 

 
\Gamma   Study modeling scenarios in the ACF basin under extreme hydrologic conditions (i.e. 2009 data for extreme flood and 1920s data for extreme drought) 

 

\Gamma   Advocate for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reconsider the uses and stated purposes for the all the Federal reservoirs to improve the balance and priorities for 

uses and stated purposes (i.e. hydropower, flood control, water supply, recreation, fish & wildlife habitat) and/or optimize the uses within the context of the Federal 
Operating Permit  
Next, Jim talked about the near-term water management practices which included:  

\Gamma   Support implementation of Tier 1 and 2 conservation activities.  
\Gamma   Require all water providers to implement conservation oriented rate structures.  
\Gamma   Encourage all water providers to implement education and outreach programs.  
\Gamma   Encourage local providers to prepare drought contingency plans.  
\Gamma   Eliminate further land application system discharges for major (greater than 1 mgd) facilities. 
 

\Gamma   Study the development of new surface water storage reservoirs.  

\Gamma   Encourage the use of farm ponds.  
\Gamma   Advocate for modification to the current operation of the federal reservoirs in the ACF basin by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

\Gamma   Establish a new instream flow targets for protection of water quality past the Columbus node to maintain a daily average flow at or above 1,350 cubic feet per 

second.  
\Gamma   Prevent reservoir levels from dropping below critical levels to meet authorized recreational use in West Point Lake such that normal operation is maintained 

between 632.5 - 635 feet NVGD. Induced flood storage between elevation 635 - 641 feet NVGD will be utilized when needed.

\Gamma   Advocate for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reconsider the uses and stated purposes for the all the Federal reservoirs to improve the balance and priorities for 

uses and stated purposes (i.e. hydropower, flood control, water supply, recreation, fish & wildlife habitat) and/or optimize the uses within the context of the Federal 
Operating Permit.  
\Gamma   Implementation of these water management practices adopts conservation to continue to foster stewardship over the region's water resources.  

 
\Gamma   Recommendations for changes to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operation of the ACF basin reflect the council's goal to help resolve the issues pertaining to 

water resources management and competing interests. Desired changes in reservoir and instream flow requirements identified have been shown to be a 
viable alternative from a modeling perspective. Adaptive reservoir management practices should be further investigated to illustrate the advantages of this 
approach for the ACF basin.  
Jim discussed long-term water management practices which address supply augmentation and reliability and represent greater regional collaboration and permitting efforts. These 
which included:  

\Gamma   Implement new surface water storage as necessary 
\Gamma   Encourage interconnection of regional supply systems

\Gamma   Advocate for changes to biological flows below Woodruff Dam based upon scientific justification study. 

 As a part of the interregional implications of selected management practice, Jim noted the 
selected management practices all involve additional resources (time, effort, money). The costs of these programs should be shared equitably between the state, local jurisdictions, 
individuals, and industries. Recommended changes in operation of federal reservoirs require further interregional coordination and planning between the Middle 
Chattahoochee.  
Council member Joe Maltese advised the council about FERC relicensing Bartletts Ferry    
One Council person requested that public/private development of groundwater be added to the list. There was also a discussion about the value of expanding sewer service into 
the older neighbors on the fringes of development. A market may exist and there may be a way to encourage communities. Council member Alan Bell said in rural Georgia cost is 
prohibitive.  
Chair Windom suggested letting the workgroup make one more revision to the strawman and asked council members to submit comments to Steve Simpson.   
 Matt then asked if the council could post the draft chapters to the plan to the website.  
After some discussion, the consensus was that after an additional review from EPD, the draft for the first 1-5 chapters could be posted online within the next two months. 
 Council member Ken Penuel asked Black & Veatch to provide the next iteration of the 
plan with strikeouts so members could see the edits.    
 Desired State Water Quantity Modeling 
 Dr. Georgakakos , Georgia Tech, presented the modeling runs performed for the Middle 
Chattahoochee Water Coalition. A copy of the PowerPoint presentation with detailed flow data was provided to the Council and is available on the council website.  
 Three main modeling scenarios were presented, each having modeled runs for current 
and future demand conditions:  

\Gamma   Current IOP operation with current and future 2050 demands 
\Gamma   MCWC-1:  Modifications to the IOP with current 2007 and future 2050 demands 
\Gamma   MCWC-2:  Modifications to the IOP with current 2007 and future 2050 demands   

MEETING SUMMARY  Page 11  
Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council  B&V Project 164139 Council Meeting 7  September 20, 2010 
Meeting Date: September 14, 2010 
 Dr. Georgakakos said that the current operation of the federal reservoirs on the 

Chattahoochee River can be improved because the seasonal inflow targets below which water can be held back for storage are exceedingly stringent.  He also said the operation 
of many reservoir systems throughout the country work to refill reservoirs as soon as possible after drought conditions, whereas the Chattahoochee reservoirs are not allowed 
to refill as soon as possible. This has had the effect of prolonging storage deficits on the order of three or more years to come back to near full pool based upon past hydrological 
conditions.    
Each of the modeled scenarios had different assumptions.  In the modeled scenarios MCWC-1 and -2, the minimum system inflow was reduced to allow the reservoirs to 
refill sooner. This increased the composite storage of the reservoir at lower basin inflows and allowed a more rapid recovery of the reservoir after drought. This also reduced the 
overall drawdown of the reservoirs during historic drought conditions.    
Dr. Georgakakos' found by modifying the IOP modification (the first version of which is described in the presentation), one could meet all existing instream flow and water supply 
requirements, and have higher Lake Lanier and West Point levels during droughts. He said his modified IOP should be further investigated as a possible approach for the ACF 
basin and help promote the desired modifications in the Army Corps of Engineers Operating Manual.  For example, he said it may be good to extend the period of record 
for his models to include the last drought.  
Dr. Georgakakos explained that much complexity exists within biological systems, that it becomes impossible to quantify the health of that system down to a given flow 
requirement.   He defended his models use of weekly time scales by saying ecology and management decision could still be made on a daily basis as long as they maintained the 
weekly average. He said the IOP does not define if ecological conditions are sustainable.   
Council member Jeff Lukken discussed the flood of 2009 and how it was 500 year flood event.  They had suggested to the Army Corps of Engineers to keep the reservoirs three 
to four feet lower before a storm to help alleviate downstream flooding.   
Judge Magnuson Ruling  
Jim Hawkins provided a synopsis of Judge Magnuson's ruling. Last year, Judge Magnuson issued a ruling (Phase 1) that stated water supply was not an originally 
authorized purpose of Lake Lanier and water supply from Lanier exceeded Corps' authority. This ruling would go into effect on July 2012. 
 On July 21, 2010, Judge Magnuson issued Phase II ruling which focused on the flow over 
Jim Woodruff Dam, the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) .  

MEETING SUMMARY  Page 12  
Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council  B&V Project 164139 Council Meeting 7  September 20, 2010 
Meeting Date: September 14, 2010 
  

Florida had argued for more water for sturgeon and two species of mussels by using the ESA.  Judge Magnuson ruled the ESA claims are without merit and must be dismissed. 
The judge also recognized that the Army Corps of Engineers violated its obligations under NEPA by implementing the initial 2006 IOP prior to seeking FWS advice. Also, 
others argued that the Corps should have prepared an EIS for the 2006 IOP or the 2008 IOP.  The judge said these NEPA claims are prudentially moot. In other words, it makes 
little practical sense for the Corps to develop an EIS for a plan that is destined to be replaced within two years. 
 Next Jim highlighted the following quotes from Judge Manuson's Phase 2 ruling. He 
encouraged the council to the read the actual ruling and said it was actually not too bad read. 
  "The Corps's rather cavalier attitude toward its duties under NEPA is 

distressing, to say the least. The Court is troubled by the Corps's refusal to take responsibility for its utter failure to conduct any sort of environmental analysis 
whatsoever on the plan by which it has operated the ACF basin for more than 20 years."  
 "Had the Corps been less recalcitrant over the past 20 years, it is possible that 
such a step (preparing a water control plan) might have forestalled this phase of the litigation altogether. But given the contentious history in the ACF Basin, it is 
not surprising that no party is willing to trust the Corps to do its job in accordance with the law."  
 "Nor will this Court, or future courts considering the Corps's actions, look 
favorably on the Corps's stubborn insistence on excluding from its analysis all reasonable alternatives in the ACF basin. For instance, an EIS that does not at 
least consider the effects of current and future water supply is....for all intents and purposes, a useless document."  
 "The Georgia parties are correct that all decision makers would benefit from the 
comprehensive analysis of a range of potential activities in the ACF basin, and it is likely that the Corps's failure to conduct such an analysis would be an abuse of 
the Corps's discretion under the [Administrative Procedure Act] APA."   
There were no questions.  
Endangered Species Act  
Sandy Tucker, supervisor of the Georgia Ecological Services Office for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), gave a presentation to the Council about the Endangered  

MEETING SUMMARY  Page 13  
Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council  B&V Project 164139 Council Meeting 7  September 20, 2010 
Meeting Date: September 14, 2010 
 Species Act (ESA). Tucker said that the law was enacted in 1973, and it is implemented 

jointly between USFWS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Tucker explained how the various sections of the Act apply in the context of 
water planning.   
Tucker stated that mussels need fish and water to reproduce. She noted that ESA prohibits "taking" of endangered or threatened animals by killing, shooting, harming, 
injuring, or harassing. Federal agencies have to ensure that their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or adversely modify critical habitat. Jeopardize 
is an important term under the Act; it means causing the listed species to go extinct sooner. To protect listed species, federal agencies consult with USFWS. Any exceptions 
to takings prohibition must be covered by a permit with USFWS. Permits require protective actions to counterbalance potentially adverse actions. 
 Tucker provided examples of federal activities that could affect listed species, such as 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) operation of reservoirs on the Chattahoochee River, federal funding for road building, and USDA FSA financial incentives and 
programs. For each of these activities, the federal agency must consider the impact of its actions and the ESA listed species.  
 Tucker said that low water years are bad for ESA listed mussels in the region. She said 
that the Council's plan will address listed species.  She said that the plan could include drought contingencies that protect flows and allow for shared pain across users in drought 
years. She said that withdrawals permitted by GAEPD have made conditions worse in drought years.   
 Tucker said that the ESA is a federal statute, but it is addressed at all of us. It gives us a 
responsibility to conserve species in trouble. The role of the USFWS is to try to strike a balance between people and listed species. 
 Council member Jeff Lukken asked if we knew the exact flows to meet particular species. 
Sandy said this would be nice, but we don't.  She said we do know there is a range of flows needed over time to sustain the species. 
 Council member Steve Davis asked if you could protect and keep species elsewhere, aka 
sturgeon.  Sandy said this would be difficult the species has to be self-sustaining.  
Council member Joe Maltese said there was a disconnect with the Georgia USFWS and Florida USFWS. In Florida, there seems to be a rapid implementation very intense 
science on places such as the Apalachicola river and it is not as intensive here in Georgia.  Sandy said she did not see the discrepancy.  She said the USFWS works on the best 
available data.

Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council  B&V Project 164139 Council Meeting 7  September 20, 2010 
Meeting Date: September 14, 2010 
 Council member Jeff Lukken asked if there was a specific tipping point and if there was, 

couldn't you add a conservative buffer to come up with the required minimum flow.  Sandy said they didn't exactly know. 
 Council member Paul Chappell asked about the movement of mussels. Sandy said that 
you can see trails left in the sand near creeks as water levels decrease.  Some mussels travel across the stream bottom, while others burrow straight down into the sediment.  
 Joe Maltese commented that he had seen a study where instead of more water needed 
downstream of Jim Woodruff dam, more sediment is actually really needed in the water.  
Chairman Windom thanked Sandy Tucker for her presentation.  
 Conservation 
  
Jim Hawkins discussed what he considered the big three; Conservation Development Plan Tiers of Conservation, Water Conservation Implementation Plan (WCIP), and the 
Water Stewardship Act of 2010.    
First, Jim discussed the four plan tiers of conservation which included the following:  

\Gamma   Tier ONE practices - mandatory through rules or law 
\Gamma   Tier TWO practices - options addressed through rule 
\Gamma   Tier THREE practices - optional, basic 
\Gamma   Tier FOUR practices - optional, beyond basic to help "close the gap"   

Next, Jim discussed the Georgia's Water Conservation Implementation Plan (WCIP) which was updated and released in March 2010. The WCIP incorporates improvements 
suggested by Georgia citizens, businesses and organizations, including:  

1.  A summary chart of critical elements of the plan: the sector-specific conservation goals, benchmarks, best practices and implementation actions;  
2.  Updated language regarding Georgia's drought conditions; and  3.  Enhanced benchmarks, definitions and references. 
 Jim said the WCIP was intended to create a culture of conservation and guide Georgians 
toward more efficient use of our state's finite water resources. He said it will help to guide decisions on water use and management:  
  1.  Educating water users about water conservation practices and the goals they can 

accomplish,  

MEETING SUMMARY  Page 15  
Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council  B&V Project 164139 Council Meeting 7  September 20, 2010 
Meeting Date: September 14, 2010 
  2.  Informing regional water plan preparation that will be overseen by regional water 

planning councils, 3.  Helping water use sectors collectively improve water use efficiency, and 
4.  Informing DNR rule-making regarding water conservation requirements in permitting.  
 Next, Jim explained the Water Stewardship Act of 2010.  He said it directs agencies to 
examine their practices and identify enhanced programming and incentives for voluntary water conservation and enhanced water supply by local water providers. It also gives 
EPD authority to establish minimum standards and best practices for public water systems to address leakage, water loss audits, and leak detection. 
 Jim said the act also gives EPD authority to revoke, suspend, or modify a local 
government authority's water withdrawal or waste treatment permit for violations of outdoor water restriction guidelines. Some other points Jim made includes: 
 

\Gamma   Farm use surface water/groundwater withdrawal permits 
\Gamma   Multi-tenant sub-metering beginning July 1, 2010 
\Gamma   High efficiency fixtures required in new construction beginning July 1, 2012 
\Gamma   High efficiency cooling devices in new industrial buildings beginning July 1, 2012 

\Gamma   Creates Joint Committee on Water Supply  
There were no questions.  
Water Quality Management Practices Recommendations  
Steve said water quality management practices were based on reviewing material from EPD such as TMDLs, water quality modeling schedule & approach and regional water 
quality related efforts. We have gathered additional data fromForestry Commission BMP Survey information, and BMPs for nurseries. 
 Steve they consolidated the strawman into bullet points and sorted the practices between 
near-term and long-term.  Steve said near-term projects were projects that could be implemented within five years. They include the following: 
  *  Near-term 

-  Support existing plans & practices and improved enforcement -  Improved land use planning, particularly stream buffers 
-  Improve BMP implementation and documentation -  Create and fund a stream buffer land acquisition program 
-  Require Georgia Stormwater Management Manual adoption -  Eliminate additional LAS for large discharges  

MEETING SUMMARY  Page 16  
Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council  B&V Project 164139 Council Meeting 7  September 20, 2010 
Meeting Date: September 14, 2010 
  -  Increased water quality monitoring & coordination 

*  Long-term -  Reduce permitted utilization of assimilative capacity 

-  Advocate for equitable nutrient criteria throughout the region -  Additional state regulation requiring stormwater utilities 
 Other recommendations include: 

*  Increased State Funding for GA EPD Advocated *  Creation of a Program for Stream Buffer Land Acquisition 

*  Increased grant funding for water quality improvement projects *  Additional funding needs to be defined for long-term water quality management 

practices   
Steve Simpson said through the Section 319(h) Grant program, there is a funding set aside of approximately $1 million for council recommended projects. This funding will 
be divided among the ten regional councils.  There is a 40% match requirement for funding from the entity administering the project. Funding can be used for projects such 
as stormwater controls and stream restoration. The committee will be reviewing this opportunity. 
 Steve also said the committee is planning to reconsider recommendation following 
review of water quality modeling results anticipated in November 2010  
Joe Maltese noted that the committee needs to add the Metropolitan North Georgia Water District plans as a source.  Steve said yes they should and reminded everyone that if there 
are more sources of data to let him know.  
Council member Ken Penuel noted that the Army Corp of Engineers Corp shoreline management plan could have tremendous impacts.  After the meeting, Ken said that the 
schedule for the shoreline management plan has been changed and the "draft" plan will not be out until January of 2011. 
 Council member Robert Watkins said he was concerned about addition regulations, such 
as for subdivision, he said they were already very detailed already for erosion and control plans.  Joe Maltese said he thought the intent was not for additional regulations, but an 
attempt to level the "playing field" from county to county.   
Chair Windom said he still does not understand the costs involved with these practices. Jim Hawkins suggested the council may need to look at the Chesapeake Bay as an 
example.  Steve Simpson said the costs can be investigated more. Ken Penuel suggested ranking the costs and Joe Maltese suggested development of a cost matrix.

Meeting Date: September 14, 2010 
 Jim Hawkins asked Jack Dozier to give his opinion.  Jack said he would be very careful 

discouraging LAS.  He thought there were not water quality impacts with these.  He said that may put the economy at a competitive disadvantage. 
 Steve Simpson said they were still looking for additional input for Section 6 of the plan. 
  
Groundwater Sustainable Yields Update  
Steve Simpson reviewed the groundwater sustainable yield updates from GAEPD. A hand-out of the results was distributed, and the slides are available on the Council 
website. Steve reviewed the prioritized aquifers map, the sustainable yield modeling metrics, and the model results for the prioritized aquifers.   
 The sustainable yield results were compared to groundwater use estimates. Steve said that 
the updated results do not change the sustainable yield estimates, but the use information that is compared to the sustainable yields has been updated. The prior use estimates have 
been updated with the Hook estimates of agricultural water use, and these estimates substantially increased the use estimates in this region. 
 The Council discussed the Dougherty Plain results in detail. The updated results show 
that the growing season average use of groundwater is above the sustainable yield for this aquifer in a median year and a dry year. Modeling results indicate that groundwater 
drawdown in this aquifer, as caused by groundwater use, is very limited. The modeling results therefore reflect similar findings to the surface water availability results already 
considered by the Council: groundwater withdrawals impact surface water flows in the region. Steve Simpson noted that GAEPD is not planning to re-calibrate the model for 
this aquifer because it is a USGS model.  
WDCP Sections 6-8 Development  
 Jim Hawkins described how the October draft would be developed.  Jim said the 
strawman documents will be combined and form the basis for Section 6.   
Jim reviewed the Table of Contents for Sections 6, 7, and 8 of the regional plan. The Table of Contents is included in the pre-meeting packet.  In addition to the strawman 
recommendations, these sections will include discussions of: fiscal implications, implementation responsibilities and schedules, recommendations to the state, alignment
