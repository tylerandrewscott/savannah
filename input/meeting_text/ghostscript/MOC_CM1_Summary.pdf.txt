 3) Water Planning Process  

An overview of the water planning process was provided to the Council members, including the roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  Water  Planning  Council  (WPC).    The  timeline  for  the  Council 
meetings was summarized.  
The different elements that will feed into the plans were discussed including the forecasts.    
Question: A Council member asked if the Carl Vinson Institute of Government was doing both the agricultural and the land cover projections.   
Answer:  The  Extension  Service  is  also  supporting  the  agricultural  forecasts,  per  Farrell  and Ashley. 
 4) MOA  

Farrell thanked everyone for their participation and the great turnout.  He stressed to the Council to make sure to ask questions throughout the day, even if the topic does not fit specifically with 
the agenda.    
Question: There was a question about the local government advisory body (LGAB) j how they would relate to the Council and how they would be informed.  Some of the counties had not yet 
heard  (from  EPD).    Response:  The  LGAB  will  be  getting  a  DVD  with  the  population  and employment forecast data soon.  The forecasts will be distributed to the Councils as well.   
 Question: Will the forecasts be available to the public?   
Response: Forecasts will eventually be available on the website.  Not certain of the timing.    
Follow up statement: The public may feel that there might be a problem with the public process if they do not also get the latest and greatest information.   
Follow up response: Everything is available under the Open Records Act.  EPD thinks that the process  will  include  an  initial  review  by  the  Council 

j  but  the  Council  will  not  have exclusive access to data.  The public will also have a chance to comment at the meeting.   

 Question:    If  there  is  a  discrepancy  in  the  population  and  employment  data;  who  has  the  final 
say in finalizing these numbers?  The Council, EPD, the LGAB?   Response: EPD will have the final decision.   
 Statement:  It  is  one member

`s  understanding that  the RDCs  will  be  involved in  looking  at  the population  and  employment  forecasts  as  well.    So  the  local  governments  will  also  be  involved 

through the RDC`'.  
Question: There was a question about how the data will be tied into the census data?   Response:  Not  certain.    The  plan  is  for  the  Georgia  OPB  to  update  the  population  and 
employment every other year.

Question:  It  looks  like  the  process  puts  the  cart  before  the  horse,  because  the  population  and employment  forecasts  are  done  simultaneously.    Will  there  be  an  opportunity  for  growth 
management suggestions based on water availability?   Response: Yes, this is important and will be considered. 
 Farrell walked the Council members through the MOA.   
 Statement:  There  were  some concerns  that there  were  design  professionals  that were excluded 
from  the  MNGWPD  process.    Before  we  accept  any  rules  we  need  to  have  another  discussion about that controversy.  There is a lot to be said for the MNGWPD, but it is exclusionary.  (He 
was  referencing  the  Georgia  Stormwater  Management  Manual  and  the  requirement  for  certain elements to be stamped by a professional engineer).   
Response: Farrell said that this was the opportunity to make sure that the exclusionary practices were not present in this process. 
 Farrell  continued  walking  through  the  documents.    He  mentioned  that  if  Council  members 
needed additional data, he would work to provide them with the requested data.  
DCA representative Adriane Wood spoke briefly  about the integration of  Comprehensive  Land Use  Plans  and  that  they  were  revising  the  timeline  for  the  updates  for  the  communities  in  the 
region.    The  hope  is  that  any  changes  can  be  accomplished  through  the  scheduled  update  or amendment to the existing Comp Plans. 
 Discussion: There was a discussion about the Council

Response:  Farrell  reminded  the  group  that  Georgia  EPD  is  still  responsible  for  permitting  and cannot  allow  a  plan  that  does  not  protect  water  resources.

different.  Agriculture  is  a  big  part  of  the  State;  we  want  to  make  sure  that  agriculture  is  not forgotten.    EPD  does  not  have  any  upfront  vision  about  how  these plans  will look 

*  that  is  the role of the Council. 

 Question: Will this plan have a homeland security element?   
Response: Farrell has not heard of that.  It is definitely an important issue and we can talk about whether this is the right forum.   
 Question: Would there be a Development of Regional Impact (DRI)

Response: The DRI process will work beyond the purview of this plan because it is a different law.  The thresholds for the DRI process are being revised at this point.  If the reservoir were for 
water  supply  it  would  be  included  in  this  plan.    If  it  were  a  private  impoundment,  it  probably would  not  be  in  this  plan.    If it  were  something to  eventually  be  turned  over to  the local  water 
agency * then it is something to discuss.  F\Pi \Theta  ffi,`\Gamma \Delta , the Water Planning Council could become a reviewer of these development projects. 
 5) Achieving Results through Consensus Decision Making  

Ashley  confirmed  that  everyone  received  the  packets  ahead  of  the  meeting.    If  there  are
