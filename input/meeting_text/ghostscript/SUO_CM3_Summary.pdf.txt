(1) Welcome and Introduction  
Chairman Cross welcomed all to the meeting and asked the public members to introduce themselves.  Chairman Cross asked if the  council members had reviewed Dr. Couch's 
memo on Judge Magnuson's ruling.  He commented  that the best thing to do is to ignore the ruling and continue our planning work since we do not know how things will play out 
and don't know what the US Army Corps of  Engineers (USACE) will do.  Bill Martello showed the Governor's message to the counc il.  The governor stressed the importance of

the regional planning work and thanked the council members for their commitment to this work. 
 Co-chair Charlie Newton offered to host the next meeting in Thomson in McDuffie 
County.  There was no objection from the memb ers and Chairman Cross confirmed that the next meeting would be held in Thomson between November 8th and 20th, 2009. 
 Mr. Martello reviewed the meeting agenda.   EPD Assistant Branch Chief Jeff Larson 
reminded council members of the Lake Hartwell tour.  
(2) Water Use Forecast Agricultural Demand Forecast - Dr. Jim Hook (USA) and Cliff Lewis (EPD) 
 Dr. Jim Hook of UGA gave the presentation on  agricultural demand forecast.  EPD asked 
UGA to assemble a team to put together ag ricultural demand forecasts for the regional planning process.  These forecasts predict how many million gallons per day (MGD) will 
be needed over the next 40 years.  The baseli ne projections start with a existing irrigation acreage and water sources.  Fifty-seven (57)  years of weather records are available in 
Georgia for comparing irrigation use in wet,  average, and dry years.  These data were analyzed to anticipate the ra nge of water use in various weather conditions.  The unit 
MGD was used for the projections because  water resource planners use MGD for planning (instead of acre-inches). 
 The irrigation acreage was estimated based on the following sources: 

\Gamma   Mapping of fields of where irrigation is applied 
\Gamma   Pending permits where irrigation is already occurring 
\Gamma   EPD withdrawal permits records 
\Gamma   Aerial imagery (2005 to 2007) for signs  of irrigation system (center-pivot system)  

 In addition, projecti ons of crop acreage we re based on the USDA  census of Agriculture 
and Annual Crop reports, Food and Agricultural Policy Institute (models are available for the SE), and the 2007 UGA Farm Gate Report (s pecialty crop).  These projections are 
updated each year and the average of the three forecasts was used for this study.  The growth is expected to be slower growth in  the next 40 years than the last 10-20 years.  
Irrigation acreage is estimated to increase about 20%.  
Dr. Hook stressed all information is shown on the georgiawaterplanni ng.org website.  He showed the various links that will show monthly withdrawal by county and breakdown of 
water use by type.  Seasonal variation vers us annualized use for wet, dry and average conditions were shown.   
 There are small pockets of agriculture in the  northern part of SUO region, but most of the 
agricultural demand is located  in the southern part of th e region.  Groundwater use is higher than surface use for Ag irrigation st atewide.  Lower Flint has the largest

\Lambda 
irrigation/agricultural producti on in the State.  Groundwater  use in the SUO region is estimated to be about 5 percent of the St ate's projected 2011 demand; surface water use 
is estimated to be about 6 percent of total st ate agricultural us e.  Water use is not static throughout the year; the irrigation needs durin g growing seasons is much higher than 
annual average use.  Daily demand varies even greater due to rainfalls.  Dr. Hook showed graph from Lower Flint.   
 Question: Are the forecasts consistent with UGA's employment projections? 
 Response: They are not tied together.  The projecti ons are not tied to  limitations on land, 
water resources or population grow th.  It is assumed that futu re growth will occur near existing location of irrigated fields. 
 Comment: Did not see any numbers for animals,  nurseries, or green houses.  Typical 
average water use on a small farm is about 1/2 inch per day.  
Response: Poultry and livestock are not included  in the agricultural demand projections.  This forecast is for irrigation demand.  Poultry is included in industrial demand. 
 Comment:  It only included permitted demand. 
 Response (Cliff Lewis): EPD does not regulate  irrigation water withdrawals less than 
100,000 gallons per day (gpd).  We had to use av ailable data and recognized there were limitations to the data.  There is a role for the council members.  The council members 
can provide specific information on the da ta EPD does not have .  The projections captured 95 percent of Georgia's irrigation needs.  Demands from container nurseries and 
livestock are in the other 5 percent.  EPD  would like to work with the council to bring this data to the planning process.   
 Chairman Cross asked how many members at tended the meetings in August held in 
Athens and Perry.  He commen ted that we knew a gap existe d, and fortunately this was a small part. 
 Comment: Suggest we change the title to reflect th at the projection is only for irrigation.  
Agriculture includes more than irrigation.  
Comment: Some farmers use both groundwater  and surface water.  The forecasts separate groundwater and surface water irrigation. 
 EPD: We started with permitted data and gr oundwater and surface water permits are 
separated.  It is roughly 60 percent groundwater and 40 percent surface water and we assume that this trend would continue. 
 Question: If we have a drought and there is no  groundwater, will EPD allow them to use 
surface water or vice versa?

Cliff asked members to get back to him if they have additional questions and comments.  
(3) Vision and Goals  
Inga Kennedy, the meeting facilitator, presen ted a straw man's draft vision statement based on members' submission.  Chairman  Cross asked members to submit their 
comments to the planning contractor and br ing the revised vision statement back for adoption in the next meeting.   
 
The Savannah and Ogeechee Rivers along with the region's groundwater resources will
provide high quality water supplies for balanced growth while protecting the natural and
built environments. The Savannah - Upper Ogeechee Regional Water Planning Council
will formulate river basin policies based on current and developing technologies and
conservation methods. 

Question: Can electronic version of the draft vision be sent to the members? Response: Yes. 
 Question: What is the definition for balanced growth? 
Response:  Balancing different interests and differ ent types of water us e.    It  may  mean different things for different people.   
 Chairman Cross:  This is a draft for members to pr ovide comments.  With all we have 
to cover in today's meeting, let's come back to it in our next meeting.  
Question: What is a built environment?  Response:  Anything that is manmade. 
 Inga requested members to submit commen ts by mid-October.  If we don't have 
consensus we can appoint an ad-hoc committee  to finish it.  She then briefly went over the draft goals based on comments received from Council members. 
 
Draft Goals:

1.  Form a permanent Savannah\Gamma Upper Ogeechee Water Council as the conduit for

bringing together all stakeholders and assisting the State with implementation of
water resource goals.

2.  Plan for sufficient water supplies to support planned economic development,

residential, industrial, agricultural, recreational and utility services in a
sustainable manner.

3.  Work with EPD to establish ongoing relationships with South Carolina

stakeholders to address water sharing issues.

\Lambda 
4.  Work to enhance the public's understanding of regional water issues and the

need for support of new policies to protect future resources.

5.  Identify opportunities for water reuse in the region.
 Chairman Cross: Each water basin should st and on its own.  The council should have a 
goal or objective that states that each region deals with what it has and makes it work.    
Question: Would it be appropriate to make a motion to make this a goal?  
Question: Do we want to take this up or do we want to wait until the next meeting?  
One council member made a motion to add a go al: to keep and to  work with the water resources within the SUO region (not allowi ng interbasin transfer).  A few members 
second the motion.    
One council member commented that the proc ess should be set up  to provide comments for adoption in the next meeting.  It is  difficult to vote without  knowing the exact 
language of the motion.  Therefore, the moti on was amended to add this statement as a goal for consideration in the next meeting.  This motion was passed unanimously.  
 Inga stressed the importance of members s ubmitting the comments to PCs prior to the 
next council meeting.  
(4) Public Involvement Plan  
Inga briefly reviewed the basi c elements of the draft public  involvement plan, including key stakeholders, procedural  criteria, meeting announcements , public comments and etc.  
Chairman Cross asked the members to provide  comments to the planning contractor and bring the revised draft back to the next meeting for discussion and adoption. 
 Question:  Who are the interested parties and how are they notified?  
 Response: EPD provided the planning contractor  a list of e-mail addresses of the 
interested parties; the list included people  that contacted EPD through the State Water Plan website.  The meeting announcement is po sted on the website.  The public notice 
and the draft agenda were sent to the media and  the list of interested parties.   Please let us know if there are other groups/individuals we should add to the distribution list. 
 Chairman Cross said that he has sche duled a town hall meeting on October 13 th in 
Columbia County to kick-off the publicity for  the planning process.  The public will be notified through local newspapers.

Comment: The educational aspect of this pla nning process is important.  The council should work harder to educate the public. 
 Comment: For the public to comment, they are asked to sign up in advance but have to 
wait until the end of the meeting to comment.   This may be a lot to ask for people to stay all day to comment at the end of the meeting.  There needs to be other ways for providing 
comments.  Can we consider written or e-mailing comments?  
Response: Written comment is always encouraged.  The planning contractor is working with EPD to set up a "contact us" link for each  planning region that wi ll direct questions 
or comments to the council chair/co-chair and the planning contractors.    
Chairman Cross :  We want everyone to have opportunities to express comments and opinions; the council reserves th e right to modify procedures and the agenda of the 
meetings.  
Question: How can we view other people's comments?  
Response: The website will be the best place to view others' comments.  Comments expressed during a council meeting are record ed in the meeting summary.  The planning 
contractor will look at ways to collect and display comments on the website.  
(5) Planning Guidance and Planning for Joint Meetings   
Bill gave an overview of Planning Guidance  and went over the joint meeting schedule and grouping.  The grouping of the joint council  meetings is based on councils that share 
the same resources (river basin or aquifer).   The first joint meeting is planned in January 2010 and the second in April of  2010.  Bill mentioned that all are invited to attend the 
joint meetings to get informed.  However, he suggested forming a sub-committee to provide continuity in attending these meetings  and to guide the plan ning contractors with 
the selection of management practices.  
Question:  How many meetings will there be?  
Response:  There are two series planned so far;  each series has six meetings (twelve total). One series will occu r in January 2010 and the sec ond series in April 2010.  SUO 
council is involved in three out of the six me etings each time.  That is a total of 6 meetings for SUO during the first half of 2010. 
 Tai-Yi Su commented that the first series  of meeting is desi gned for sharing the 
availability and the water quality of the  resources; hopefully demand forecasts will be available at the time.  Subsequent meetings  are to share initial se lection of management 
Practices from each council.  Meetings during  the later part of 2010 may require councils to resolve conflicts if the numbers do not add up. 
 Question: When will the meetings be?  We can't plan unless we have dates.

\Lambda 
 Response: The dates are not available yet.  The planning contractor will inform the 
council as soon as they are scheduled.  
Chairman asked if co-chair Newton can attend all meetings.  Mr. Newton said it would be hard.  Chairman Cross asked council members to let him know if they would like to serve 
on the sub-committee.    
(6) Population and Employment Forecasts  
Mr. Martello provided an updated status of the population and employmment projections.  The projections are currently be ing revised and are targeted to  be available in October.  
The revised population projections will now include a baseli ne residential population and the employment factors will be separated.  Employment projections will only be provided 
for twelve categories of major water-using industries.  
Question:  Why is the population and employment separated?  
Response: The uncertainty in how em ployment trends affect  population resulted in the revised approach of decoupling the population and employment projections.    
 Question: How does it take into account, for ex ample, a Toyota plant that may employ 
several thousand people in the  communities?  Will the water use be included in industrial use? 
 Response: If the industries fall within the twelve  categories, it would be covered in the 
industrial demand projections.  
Comment:  I recalled the P & E projections would be updated every two years.   
Response:  It would be updated more frequent  than census update (Note:  it was confirmed that the population projections will be updated every two years.) 
 (7) Municipal and Industrial Water Demand and Wastewater Flow Forecasts 
 Municipal water demand forecasts will in clude water demands for residential, 
commercial and light industrial uses.   
Question:  Does the 75 gpcd for self-supplied wa ter assume the self-supplied population uses less water than customers  on public supply?  It is in  the low range of the proposed 
75 to 175 gpcd used for publicly-supplied population.  
Response:  The USGS estimated self-supplied  quantity using 75 gpcd.  The council can provide data for adjustment if they are available.

\Lambda 
Comment:  We (water systems) supply per cap ita water use calculations to EPD each month.  Will these data be used? 
 Response:  EPD has provided withdraw al and discharge record  database and we will use 
these data to adjust the initial per capita  water use rate calculated based on the USGS data. 
 Planning Contractor : The council's input is needed  for the future self-supplied 
population scenarios.  The planning contr actor will begin with  two scenarios: one scenario will be based on current ratio of  self-supplied and pub licly-supplied population; 
the second will be based on historical tre nds of self-supplied and publicly-supplied population.   We can work on a third scenario  if specific information (such as future 
water system expansion plans)  is available to customize fu ture trends.  The council will help select a scenario for gap analysis. 
 Question: Does the category "Elect ric Machinery" include pr oduction of motors for car 
manufacturers?  
Response:  We will have to look at NAICS and SIC sub-categories to confirm.  
Question: Where is power generation?  We have  two major coal power generation plants in the SUO planning region, Pl ant Washington and Plant Voge l.  Plant Washington uses 
groudwater and will tap into the Ogeechee watershed.  
Response:  The water needs for power generation will be handled separately from the M&I demand.  The projections wi ll be in the "energy" catego ry.  EPD is working on this 
with assistance from the energy companies.   There are four categories:  agricultural, energy, municipal and industrial. 
 Question: How much do Plant Washington and Plant Vogel currently use? Response: Liz 
Booth (EPD) commented that the water use fro m Plant Washington is included in the groundwater model.  Chairman Cross comment ed that existing energy permits are shown 
on EPD's permitting records on the website.  
Mr. Martello described the proposed public  input process for municipal water and wastewater forecast.  The council is asked to  provide five represen tatives to attend two 
meetings planned in late September.  One m eeting each will be held on the eastern and western part of Georgia, re spectively.  Chairman Cross asked for volunteers for the 
public input meetings.  
Jeff Larson (EPD) commented that the five re presentatives can be five council members or the council member's local resources.    EPD is looking for experts with knowledge of 
water consumption to provide  input for your community.  The  idea is to get information before the forecasts.  Council members need to  think about who they would like to bring 
to these public meetings.

Chairman Cross asked how many from the coun cil know what is permitted or used in your community.  Few raised hands.  He then  asked how many represent water providers 
or are water service managers?  Four council me mbers raised their hands.  Clarification:  two meetings will be offered and the counc il member need only attend one meeting 
planned during the last week of September.  
Chairman Cross appointed the following member s to attend the public meeting in late September: Mike Eskew, Don Dye Bruce Azevedo, Pat Goran, also Columbia County's 
water manager.    
Question: Do we need to find out what South Carolina is pulling?    
EPD (Larson) : We are working with South Caro lina; they don't have a lot of information on water withdrawals. 
 Chairman Cross mentioned that council member Braye Boardman is on the committee 
with Dr. Couch working with South Carolina.  
(8) Resource Assessment  
Dr. Wei Zeng (EPD hydrology unit) and Dr. Ge orge McMahon gave the presentation on surface water availability assessment. 
 

\Gamma   Water Use data compilations: gathered data of all withdrawal and discharge facilities 

\Gamma   Observed flow data compilations: gathered available USGS data, including in gap in data 
\Gamma   Unimpaired data: gathered sum of what  is measured (USGS) and what is consumed  
\Gamma   River basin delineation: The  basin or aquifer has been  divided into small units (sub-basins) 
\Gamma   Planning node: all info (withdrawal a nd discharge data) upstream the planning nodes will be grouped together in resource assessment 
  
Question:  Are these (planning nodes) gage locations?    
Response: Yes.  Basic nodes are located where l ong-term monitoring data is available and planning nodes are a sub-set of basic nodes. 

 Dr. Zeng explained the desired flow regime  - what needs to be  protected in the 
environment:  water quality and minimum flow  requirements (for aquatic life).  The Council has the flexibility to go beyond basic  minimum low flow requirement to include 
other "desired flow" such as recreation or others.  EPD has assembled SEEP experts from across Georgia and the country to provide inpu t on resource assessment.  The models are

used as an accounting tool to account for the quantity of flow comes in and goes out and whether we can meet desired flow regime.  After existing condition assessment, we move 
to future assessment using M & I demand fo recasts, energy and agricultural demands to address potential gap in the future.  The counc il will select MP to  meet gap.  EPD will 
work with the council and planning contract ors in an iterative manner to select management practices.   

 Dr. Zeng showed the map with withdrawal and  discharge clusters.   The exact locations 
of these withdrawals and discha rges cannot be shown because of security concerns.  He asked the council to review the data and let  EPD know if there are corrections.  Initial 
results will be reported in the January joint meeting.  
Question: What is the degree of uncertainty of the model?  
Response: Stream flow and evaporation predicti ons are close to actual measurements.  Wastewater returns and water uses not in th e right locations can  contribute to potential 
error of the model.  
Dr. Zeng reminded the audience th at the model is built to lo ok at a magnitude of several hundred square miles.  Dr. McMahon mentioned  that the historical  streamflow data is 
available up to late 1930s.  
Comment: The land cover back in the 1930s was likely very different.  
Question: What is the percent of evaporation considered?   
Response:  Evaporation is calculated based on regional pan evaporation data.  
Question:  Why is it important to have unimpaired flow and how will we use it?  
Response:  As if trying to reconstruct the raw materials and recipes after a cake was already baked, the unimpaired flow approach tries to start with the maximum natural flow 
in the streams without excluding current water uses.  
Question: Do we consider runoff? 
Response: No.  Runoff estimation includes lots of  parameters; we have to use the best available data (streamflow data) that is available. 
 Dr. Liz Booth gave the presentation on the  water quality resource assessment.  She 
discussed the definition of assimilative capa city and then showed the impaired stream segments in the Savannah-Upper Ogeechee planning region based on organics, pH, 
toxicity, Fish consumption, dissolved oxygen ( DO), biota (sediment), and fecal coliform.  EPD will be developing DO standards for  naturally low DO streams in 2010 and is 
looking at revising bacterial standards.

Assimilative capacity may be affected by future land use pattern,  population growth and the increase in impervious surface area.  UGA is currently developing future land use 
forecasts for the regional planning efforts. 
The DO Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL)  for the Savannah harbor has affected dischargers all the way upstream to Augusta.   Additional EPD staff has been added to 

collect water quality data; they also collect actual discharge data for calibration of the model.  Plant Vogel is included for its thermal discharges. Seven years of USGS data will 
be used for model calibration.  Effects of non- point source will be tr anslated to estuary water quality in the model.  The council might  look at using green  infrastructure in the 
future to manage storm water, NPS and increased impervious surface.  
(9) Management Practice  
Mr. Martello announced that a detailed presen tation of Management Practices would be postponed to the next meeting because the meeting was behind schedule.  A menu of 
management practices will be prepared for  the Council to review and there will be a preliminary discussion on ranking criteria.   
 (10) Corps of Engineers Presentation 
Reservoir Management and Drought in the Savannah River Basin Presented by Jason Ward, Hydrologist, USACE 
 Lake Hartwell was originally authorized  for hydropower, flood protection and navigation 
purposes.  Water supply was added later as  an authorized purpose. (Note from the planning contractor:  water qua lity and fish and wildlife ma nagement also were added 
later as authorized purposes.)  
Chairman Cross asked how many of the council  members plan to part icipate in the Lake Hartwell tour and twenty council members responded yes. 
 Question:  Will we have the same problem as Lake Lanier? 
 Response:  The authorized purposes include wa ter supply and water quality for Lake 
Hartwell.  It is a different kind of aut horization and should hold up.  The USACE is currently reviewing the authorization to confirm. 
   Question:  Where is the lake level typically in September? 
 Response: Currently we are about 2.5 feet below av erage.   The system is in Level 2 
drought currently.  We are still in drought status. We had a temporary relief in March this year, but high evaporation over lake this su mmer exceeded inflows to the lake and the 
lake level has not entirely recovered.  Th e system conservation storage (three lakes combined) reached new low records in Jan 09 and has recovered since.

The drought severity was determined based  on 57 years of record s.  The 2007 and 2008 droughts were our new historical minimum.     The inflow was about 1,705 cfs in August 
2009, minus 1100 cfs for evaporation, and the  remaining was for downstream use.  Because of the drought, there was shortage in  power production; the streamflow was in 
the lowest 10% range for historical record s.  The drought outlook of November 2009 has improved; we are expecting near and above  normal precipitation in the Savannah River 
Basin.  
Question: How is the minimum flow estimated?   
Question:  Do you have any problem releasing 3,100 cfs at Lake Thurmond last year?  
Response:  The Savannah River Site was within 0.5 foot of intake going dry.  
Mr. Ward showed the impact on lake level af ter a major rain event on December 9, 2008.  The water level in Lake Thurmond went up  6 feet; however, the la ke level at Lake 
Hartwell only went up 6 inches because Lake  Hartwell received less intense rainfall during the event and Hartwell is a large lake with a relatively small drainage basin.   Lake 
Thurmond has a much larger drainage basi n and can capture much more runoff during rainstorms.   
 Question: Do the public groups understand what the USACE needs to do? 
 Response: We held public meetings to explain and communicate the situation.   
 Questions: Do the two groups have different goals and can the difference be resolved? 
 Response:  Savannah District is hoping to conduct  Phase II of the Savannah River Basin  
Comprehensive Study; the study is currently unf unded at Federal level.   In the study, the impacts of reallocation of the storage will  be evaluated to look  at trade-off between 
different uses.    
Comment: The council will review the resource capacity and how it will meet the needs.    
Response (USACE) :    We  also  need  to  make  sure  we are doing right environmentally.  The council can help all intere sted groups to be on the same page.  The states determine 
allocation for all users.  Federal agency  (USACE) manages the storage vessels.  USACE needs the states to advise on long-term allocation strategies. 
 The new drought contingency plan rules  based on the 2006 update effort changed 
maximum release to 4,200 cfs for Level I droug ht, which allows the storage to go longer in drought.  However, there ar e cost trade-off between hydropower productions and other 
uses of the lake, including re creational use.  Phase II woul d further evaluate trade-off between various uses and will include cost comparisons and comparisons of effects of 
reallocation scenarios for reservoir storage.   In general, it will help downstream water quantity as well and all other uses, with the exception of hydropower.

LAKE HARTWELL ASSOCIATION COMMENTS TO GEORGIA REGIONAL WATER PLANNING COUNCIL 
September 17, 2009              
LHA has been heavily involved in the statewide water planning process in Georgia. The current phase of development of a Comprehensive Water Plan is the work of Regional 
Planning Councils to add basin and area unique perspectives and input to the overall plan. LHA director Pat Goran currently serves on the Savannah/Ogeechee Basin Regional 
Council. LHA plans to provide the following input to the Council as part of their public comment period. 
  1.  LHA strongly supports statewide water planning efforts as a means to achieve 

the equitable sharing of our finite resources. We were an early member of the Georgia Water Coalition and participated on the Savannah/Ogeechee Basin 
Advisory Committee. We are heavily involved in achieving similar water planning legislation in South Carolina. 
2.  LHA believes in the principles of riparian water rights in that all users in a basin have the right to reasonable consumptive use. Water is not a commodity to 

be sold, traded, or moved to users outside the basin. 3.  Decision making for the SRB must include dialog and consensus with South 
Carolina and the Corps of Engineers; otherwise any agreement will be worthless. LHA strongly supports completion of the Basin Comprehensive Study by the 
USACE. This should provide necessary data to achieve fair allocation of resources and a congressionally approved interstate compact. 
4.  Current USACE management of the SRB is far from optimum, particularly in drought situations. We support development of an adaptive management 

approach wherein lake outflows are continuously controlled based on real-time monitoring of inflows and downstream flows and conditions. 
5.  Due to its proximity to the Thurmond Dam, the operation of the Augusta Canal places severe limitations on the ability to implement effective adaptive 

management. We believe the Regional Council should review this system to determine whether the benefits of this operation justify the overall impact on 
the SRB. 6.  Climatologists universally agree that future southeastern droughts will get 
progressively more severe. This has been proven in the past decade with successive droughts of record. Water planning must take this into account. 
Using only historical data will grossly over estimate available water resources. 
7.  The USACE Drought Contingency Plan is inadequate. It must be made more aggressive in timing and action to preserve water resources for all basin 

users to supply minimum needs throughout future droughts. 8.  Until it can be established that water supply is available to meet basin needs 
now and in the future in severe drought conditions, no new permits should be issued for significant consumptive use from the SRB. This would include the

proposed Plant Vogtle expansion. And any new permitting should require best available technology to minimize consumptive use. Completion of the Basin 
Comprehensive Study listed in item 3 would establish available water quantities. 
9.  Ongoing demands to increase capacity at Savannah Harbor will further stress SRB resources due to water quality impacts. The same is true of further 

shifting water supply to the city of Savannah away from groundwater and to the river. The Regional Council needs to work with their Coastal counterpart to 
ensure that all efforts are being made to mitigate the impacts, particularly during droughts. Examples would include oxygen supplement systems for the 
harbor, and moving the Savannah drinking water intake sufficiently upstream to avoid salt-water intrusion at low in-stream flows.  
10. An accurate, scientifically established definition of water users, water needs and flow rates in the lower river are needed to define fair allocation of water 

from the upper river. Once again, completion of the Basin Comprehensive Study listed in item 3 would establish available water quantities.
