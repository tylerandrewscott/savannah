Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division, Watershed Protection Branch 4220 International Parkway, Suite 101, Atlanta, Georgia 30354 Linda MacGregor, P. E., Branch Chief 404/675-6232 FAX: 404/675-6247  September 18, 2009 MEMORANDUM  TO:  Council Members  FROM:  Kevin Farrell, GA EPD Doug Baughman, CH2MHILL  SUBJECT:  Meeting 3 Summary Upper Oconee Water Planning Council Meeting  Georgia Comprehensive Statewide Water Management Plan Regional Water Planning Council Meeting 3 Summary Meeting Date: Location:  September 15, 2009 Cuscowilla (Putnam County)  1) Welcome and Introductions Chair David Bennett called the meeting to order and invited Putnam County Chair Tom Thompson to take a few minutes to speak on his county. Thompson welcomed the Council and other attendees to Putnam County and encouraged them to explore the amenities the area has to offer.  The Chair then explained that meetings would now be run by Council leadership (Chair and Vice Chair) with support from planning contractors. He pointed out how discussion would occur in the meeting – that comments would be allowed after major agenda items were presented in the following order: Council, elected officials, and general public. He said written comments were preferred, even if someone addressed the Council in person, and would be posted to the website.  Meeting Summary Upper Oconee Water Planning Council Meeting #3 September 15, 2009      The Chair then touched on Judge Magnuson's July 17 ruling that water supply is not an authorized use of Lake Lanier and detailed Governor Perdue's four-pronged strategy for responding to the ruling: appeal, negotiation, contingency planning, and congressional reauthorization. Next came a video message from the governor stressing the importance of all the Councils' work, now more than ever, in creating a statewide water plan. Finally, The Chair gave an update on the July 13 meeting with Dr. Carol Couch (EPD) and the Senate and House Agriculture Chairs.  2) Meeting Context and Planning Guidance The Chair then talked about holding joint meetings between Councils. This issue had come up based on topics raised at the July 13 meeting. It would provide Councils opportunities to learn about shared resources, discuss management practices, and ensure consistency across the planning regions. Joint meetings would be "resource based" with resource referring to a watershed or aquifer. A series of six meetings across the state has been proposed with the first meeting being held in January 2010.  The Chair opened up discussion on options for Upper Oconee's participation in joint meetings:  Council Comment: It might be appropriate for Chair and Vice Chair to attend joint meeting. Council Comment: Maybe it should depend on the topic. There might be some Council members with specific expertise in a certain area. EPD Response: Since meetings will be resourced based, it would be up to the Councils as to how they wanted to handle participation.  The Chair said Council would revisit this topic at the next Council meeting (November 18) and asked EPD to provide an agenda of the joint meeting set for January by that time.  Vice Chair Richard McSpadden mentioned that by the January Council meeting, the group would be selecting management practices to help meet the gaps between resources and demand.  After this, the Chair reviewed the planning guidance provided by EPD and explained where this meeting fits into the planning process. He quickly ran through the milestones for the entire planning process and the roles and responsibilities of the Council and EPD related to the process. These are as follows:  2     Meeting Summary Upper Oconee Water Planning Council Meeting #3 September 15, 2009      Milestone  Regional Water Planning Council Activities Schedule  Regional vision and goals  April 2009 – September 2009  Assessment of baseline resource capacity  November 2009 – March 2010  Forecasts of demand  February 2009 – March 2010  Gap analysis  January 2010 – October 2010  Water management practices to adjust demand and resource capacity  January 2010 – January 2011  Recommend regional water plan  January 2011 – June 2011  Council’s responsibilities include: •  Develop a recommended plan  •  Submit to EPD by January 31, 2011  •  Make revisions based on EPD and public comment and finalize recommended plan by June 30, 2011.  EPD’s responsibilities include: •  Provide guidance and template to ensure completeness and consistency  •  Provide public notice and 45-day comment period  •  Review recommended plan for consistency with State Water Plan, rules and guidance  •  Adopt recommended plan if consistent with State Water Plan, rules and guidance  •  Use final adopted plan to guide agency decision making  3) Review Visioning/Goals/Objectives The Vice Chair led the next portion of the meeting reminding Council members of the Vision Statement adopted at the previous meeting:  Create a regional plan that focuses on managing water as a critical resource vital to our health, economic, social and environmental well being. Build trusting partnerships with neighboring regions and develop an educated and engaged citizenry that embraces sound water management.  From this, with input from the planning contractors, the Vice Chair developed draft goals related to the Vision Statement and asked for feedback from the Council. The draft goals presented were: 3     Meeting Summary Upper Oconee Water Planning Council Meeting #3 September 15, 2009         Promote alternatives and technologies that reuse, return, and recycle water within the Upper Oconee region    Identify new reservoir opportunities that balance economic development, recreation, and environmental interests    Educate water users in the region on the importance of water conservation and increased water efficiency    Identify programs, projects, and educational messages to reduce non-point source pollution to protect water quality in lakes and streams    Establish rate structures (water, sewer, and/or stormwater) that provide sufficient revenues to maintain a high level of service while promoting water conservation and efficiency    Balance all water interests (development, agriculture, industry, environment, etc.) within the Upper Oconee region with water quality and water quantity considerations  The Vice Chair mentioned that the goals needed a measurable component and at this point were not quite specific enough. He said he did not get any volunteers for his request to form a subcommittee to create goals. He then opened the topic for discussion.  Council Comment: Promote technology to recycle water is an important goal; tighten language up to encourage recycling (tax incentives). What is a meaningful goal i.e. what are progressive communities able to recycle? Contractor/EPD Response: Should have a decent estimate of the consumptive use from the resource assessments. Contractor Question: Should 303d list be mentioned in the goals? Water quality portion? Council Comment: Reservoir opportunities – assumes that reservoirs are pending. Needs to be changed so that it notes that these are to be considered, if needed, as one component. EPD Comment: Don’t forget to include water withdrawals. Council Comment: “Education of water users…” should be stated more actively. Council Comment: Conservation should be the top goal (with corresponding model ordinances for implementation of plan). For example, Athens-Clarke County did well in the drought. Add to first bullet just before reuse to include conservation. Public Comment: Noted that conservation pricing has been a successful BMP. Council Comment: There is a cost of conservation; it saves water but has large economic impact on local 4     Meeting Summary Upper Oconee Water Planning Council Meeting #3 September 15, 2009      utilities. Council Comment: Each system is different and has different break-even points to fund O & M [operations and maintenance] versus capital costs. Careful about prescribing a one size fits all solution and unintended consequences of goals. Council Comment: Age of system is key factor. We realized a 40 percent savings when conservation pricing was implemented so couldn’t service debt on capital system. Council Comment: Need to develop a variety of models to choose from. Council Comment: Recommend inserting “innovative” before rate structures in the goal. Council Comment: Tweak education goal to address improved accessibility to water resource monitoring data by the public. Council Comment: Include a specific water quality goal. Make sure to include existing utility plans in the Plan, i.e. not meant to usurp local plans. Public Comment: Encourage to think of conservation and efficiencies as two distinct policy tools. [Ben Emanual/Georgia River Network]  The Vice Chair said he would spend more time working on the goals and would incorporate some of the revisions that were suggested.  4) Water Use Forecasts This portion of the agenda was broken into three sections: Population and Employment Forecast Update, Municipal and Industrial Demand Forecast Methodology, and Agricultural Demands. Council Coordinator Doug Baughman provided a quick update on the population and employment forecast. The Chair thanked the Council for their comments on the topic, noting that he had received a significant number of them. He added that the Department of Community Affairs (DCA) and UGA are in the process of addressing them and that revised population/employment figures should be available no later than early October.  Municipal and Industrial Demand Forecast Methodology Planning contractor Brian Skeens followed the update with a presentation on the methodology for forecasting municipal and industrial demand. He noted that the forecasts will: •  Be based on the continuation of current trends and the practices of the future  •  Exclude any new management practice that may alter demand  •  Not establish the efficiency of water use 5      Meeting Summary Upper Oconee Water Planning Council Meeting #3 September 15, 2009      •  Serve as a basis for regional planning, not making individual permitting decisions  Discussion occurred throughout Skeens' presentation and after he was finished. The Chair noted that the Upper Oconee has a number of transient populations and asked Skeens to address them directly. He added that Dr. Couch told him and the Vice Chair that transient populations could be modified if the Council provided substantive, defensible data supporting the changes.  Chair Comment: Could planning contractors provide the 2005 report [USGS Water Use Report] to Council? EPD Response: EPD working with USGS to create a web site with the USGS 2005 water use data. It should be available in the next month. Council Comment: The steady state estimates of transient populations make him nervous since retirement growth continues; also concerned about historical growth that transitions populations from use of wells/groundwater to surface water. Council Comment: Will projections drill down to the County or City? Contractor Response: County is the lowest level currently but the data will really roll up to the watershed level. Council Comment: Many transient populations are shifting however some of these are captured by the census (prisoners). Council Comment: Navy School is closing in Athens and is being replaced by the Medical School of Georgia. May end up being a wash. Council Comment: Developed subdivision lots (thousands) that are sitting vacant, over 6000 lots in Jackson County alone. How are these included in the projections? Council Comment: Oconee County had a comprehensive analysis of the population and employment projections that will be shared with planning contractors. Council Comment: New residents are continually raising the per capita water use overall; additionally, many of the seasonal residents are turning into permanent residents. Contractor Comment: Data will capture public and private water suppliers.  The Chair asked Vince Ciampa to serve on a subcommittee to review the M&I numbers. Ciampa agreed but said he would need additional help from other members.  6     Meeting Summary Upper Oconee Water Planning Council Meeting #3 September 15, 2009      Agricultural Demands UGA Professor Jeff Mullen rounded out the forecast portion of the agenda with a look at agricultural demands. He pulled up the water planning website to show actual projections to the Council (http://www.nespal.org/sirp/waterinfo/State/awd/agwaterdemand.htm). Mullen noted that the projections only reflect irrigation and not water consumed by poultry or livestock. Discussion occurred during and after Mullen’s presentation.  Vice Chair Comment: Table [showing acreage of crops grown] should use X’s instead of zeros to represent crops not grown in certain counties. Mullen Response: A zero does not indicate lack of data but reflects that none of these commodities are anticipated. Recommends that a smell test be done for each of the counties in the Upper Oconee to examine whether the “0” numbers are correct. Council Comment: Wholesale nursery owners in many of the counties that the data shows as a “0”. Mullen Response: Projections are based on baseline permit, meters and then augmented by reviewing aerial mapping. This is not the end all; these projections will be updated again in five years. They also encourage industries such as wholesale nurseries to examine ways to capture their use for characterization such as surveys. Chair Comment: This doesn’t necessarily give the Upper Oconee the information they need to complete their water planning since it doesn’t capture the green industry or consumption by livestock and poultry. Mullen Response: UGA is still open to adjusting these agricultural inputs based on Council feedback. Not sure about the appropriate venue for integrating the poultry and livestock. Council Comment: Was there a correlation between the County Guide and UGA’s numbers? Public Comment: Recommended using the USDA to estimate green industry use. [Chris Butts/Georgia Green Industry Association] Mullen Response: Problem is that none of the different sources for data are consistent. 2008 County Extension numbers were used as a basis and then used with aerial mapping to break them out proportionally. Public Comment: GGIA happy to help with data. [Chris Butts/Georgia Green Industry Association] Mullen Response: Additional data would be helpful.  As a result of the presentation and discussion, The Chair appointed Danny Hogan, Bill Ross, Pat Hardy and Terry England to a subcommittee to examine the agricultural usage numbers.  7     Meeting Summary Upper Oconee Water Planning Council Meeting #3 September 15, 2009       5) Management Practices Baughman presented an overview to water management practices that focused on quality and quantity. He told Council that in selecting practices, they will essentially answer two questions: are the regional goals met? And do any gaps need to be filled? The practices themselves will take into account reasonable methods, available technology and economic factors when it comes to managing water demand, water supply, water return [to sources], and pollution control and prevention. At the next meeting, Council will be presented with a suite of management practices. Council will then develop a decision matrix to rank and set priorities for the practices. Discussion followed.  Vice Chair Comment: Why are systems getting away from LAS [land application] Response: Considered consumptive use and the cost of suitable land. Chair Comment: Council should avoid any interbasin transfer recommendations. Council Comment: Some of the data that the 303d streams list is based on seems suspect or questionable. Chair Comment: Restricting property rights to control impervious surfaces can be tricky to implement. Public Comment: Promoting infiltration can be a good thing, but quantity practices focus too much on consumptive use. Encouraged Council to remember that infiltration can be a good thing. [Mark Rissi/UGA]  6) Public Involvement Plan The Vice Chair and Council Facilitator Marci Davis led the portion of the agenda on the public involvement plan (PIP). The PIP details how the Council will engage and involve the various parties interested in the planning process. The goals of the PIP are: •  Maintain transparency of the planning process  •  Seek input from key stakeholders  •  Establish communications with neighboring councils  Davis noted that the Council was different in the way it was allowing comments throughout the meeting as opposed to just at the end. She also mentioned that it had incorporated some proactive outreach elements such as proposed town hall meetings in the north, south, and middle sections of the basin and individual efforts by Council members to seek out speaking engagements in their communities. She pointed out that the Vice Chair had already begun this effort with a presentation on the water planning process to the Oconee County Rotary Club in September. Members were provided this presentation on a CD to use as a template for presentation in their communities. Discussion followed. 8     Meeting Summary Upper Oconee Water Planning Council Meeting #3 September 15, 2009       Council Comment: Could another term be used besides town hall? Chair Response: Council could look through plan and make suggestions for improvement. Council Comment: Will templates [for presentations] continue to be provided in the future? Council Comment: It would be good to have something written that members could give to their local print media after meetings. Council Comment: Agree that an article or press release would be helpful. Vice Chair Comment: A standard press release will be released after each meeting and sent to Council members for them to distribute to their local papers, etc. Will need volunteers from each county to make sure that someone is getting release issued. Public Comment: Like the idea of the speakers’ bureau. [Marilyn Hall/Athens-Clarke County] Council Comment: Need to include information about the speakers’ bureau on the website and in press releases.  The PIP was adopted by Council with the understanding that it is an open target and can be amended as needed.  7) Resource Assessments Dr. Liz Booth, EPD, provided a look at the resource assessments EPD is conducting. Booth manages EPD’s watershed planning and monitoring program. Three sets of Resource Assessments (surface water availability, surface water quality and ground water availability) will be provided to the council. The Resource Assessments will be based on the boundary of the resources (watershed and aquifer), not planning regions. There are fourteen major river basins in Georgia. The watersheds are broken into planning nodes. The planning node locations were selected to catch water withdrawals and wastewater discharges. The basic nodes are selected at locations where long-term monitoring data is available. The model will include water to support instream flow needs and recreational needs Dr. Booth showed the impaired stream segments in the Upper Oconee planning region based on organics, pH, toxicity, fish consumption, dissolved oxygen (DO), biota (sediment), and fecal coliform. EPD is developing new DO standards for naturally low DO streams and is looking at better bacterial standards currently. Assimilative capacity may be affected by future land use pattern, population growth and the increase in impervious surface area. UGA is currently developing future land use forecasts for the regional planning 9     Meeting Summary Upper Oconee Water Planning Council Meeting #3 September 15, 2009      efforts. EPD has a water quality monitoring group and also contracts with USGS. EPD is looking at all historic data that has been collected. The information generated a good deal of discussion both during and after the presentation.  Council Comment: What was meant by yield? Booth Response: The amount of water that can be withdrawn. Council Comment: What are considered unacceptable impacts? Booth Response: Groundwater levels that aren’t recovering. Saltwater intrusion. Council Comment: Where did the 7% for livestock come from? [refers to pie chart showing total water withdrawals] Booth Response: 2005 USGS data. Poultry processing industry is being rolled into the industrial usage. Grow out is not included [water used by animals]. Does not include livestock or green industry. Chair Comment: I’m concerned that we have not accounted for water use in livestock and green industry. Council Comment: The data I’ve seen has processing under industrial, but doesn’t account for growing. [poultry, livestock] EPD Response: Poultry processing included in industrial. Public Comment: You are correct on this. Makes sense to have agricultural groups do this as opposed to individual councils. We were never asked to look at livestock or poultry industry. [Mark Rissi/UGA] Booth Resposne: We’ll get clarification on this. Chair Comment: You have projections. Those are the USDA numbers that come out. Commodities traders have that. Council Comment: I took the cows out of the water and now I have quality and quantity problems. Council Comment: What is a water balance model? Booth Response: Includes rainfall, infiltration, knowing how much water goes on the ground. The vetting process for surface water modeling includes review by the engineering/scientific advisory panel. Chair Comment: How is the panel looking at agricultural use [irrigation]? Don’t agree that agricultural use is 100% consumptive. Booth Response: Will check with panel for clarification. Public Comment: There is a study underway at the Strickland Irrigation Center. If there are many consumptive losses that means farmers are not irrigating efficiently. There are questions on the amount of surface water available. What sorts of climate change models are being used? [Mark Risse/UGA] 10     Meeting Summary Upper Oconee Water Planning Council Meeting #3 September 15, 2009      Booth Response: 1939 to present data set is being augmented to reflect the possibility of more extreme conditions. We’re putting in more severe droughts and more severe hurricanes. Council Comment: How do we know what chemicals these facilities use? Booth Response: Database of these facilities has been developed. Should have the baseline Resource Assessments by end of year. Council Comment: How many TMDL implementation plans for the region? Booth Response: A lot. Instead EPD will develop a Watershed Improvement Plan (WIP) that information can be fed into. Six new staff members were hired in Tifton and another 12 will be hired over the next two years. USGS staff will still install the gauges and EPD will collect samples from District offices. This will be fed into an online water quality tool. Right now we don’t charge fees for withdrawals or discharges, but if we did it would help support this. Council Comment: Can we charge fees? Booth Response: We are looking into this. Council Comment: How is the data QC'ed [quality control] Booth Response: It must meet the SQAPP (Sampling Quality Assurance Project Plan). Council Comment: What about fecal coliform exceedences? We have volunteers that monitor and can't duplicate EPD's results. Booth Response: We have added a mechanism to use volunteer data as a guide for EPD's work.  8) MOA Execution The Chair stated that while he felt he Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) could use a little more refining, it was probably best for the Council to go ahead and sign it. All members present signed the MOA.  At this point, the Chair noted that there was too much work to accomplish with just him and the Vice Chair as leadership and that he would like to appoint an executive committee to help guide the Council. Pat Graham, Roger Folsom, and Richard Bentley accepted the Chair’s request to serve on this committee.  Additional members were appointed to the Municipal and Industrial subcommittee. They final roster included Vince Ciampa, Rabun Neal, Alan Foster, and Charlie Armentrout.  9) Elected Official and Public Comment Even with public comment solicited throughout the meeting, the floor was opened near the end of the 11     Meeting Summary Upper Oconee Water Planning Council Meeting #3 September 15, 2009      meeting for any additional thoughts. There were no comments from elected officials.  Public Comment: How will the proposed Plant Washington permits affect the Regional Plan? There is a public hearing on October 20. But the plant may or may not be built. Is this facility included in the modeling? [Lyle Lansdell] EPD Response: Yes, it will be considered and the project is doing specific, more detailed modeling. [Liz Booth] Public Comment: Want to let Council know that DNR agencies will serve as a resource for the Council particularly regarding fish issues. [Patti Lanford/ Georgia DNR (Fisheries)]  10) Wrap up/Council Meeting 3 Evaluation Davis recapped the Meeting 2 Evaluation, stating that for the most part Council was pleased with the direction of the meetings and amount of information. She also noted that the previous meeting location (Reynolds Landing) received high marks. She encouraged Council members to write specific comments as this would help bring up important topics and shape future meetings.  The Chair proposed a field trip to be held in conjunction with Meeting 4, either to a Georgia Power facility or the new Putnam/Baldwin County Water Plant. He said it would take careful planning and might mean having a longer meeting, but that it would be important for members to see how water is used firsthand. There was a unanimous vote to participate in these field trips.  The Chair let Council know that the Mayor of Winder had invited the group to hold a future meeting in the city. He also reminded Council that the next meeting would be held on Wednesday, November 18 in Milledgeville.  11) Summary of Action Items 1. Agricultural forecast subcommittee to review information provided by planning contractors and others and provide input. 2. Vice Chair to revise goals based on Council discussion. 3. Municipal and Industrial usage subcommittee to review information provided by planning contractors and others and provide input. 4. Public Information Plan to be amended to include press releases for each meeting; plan will also be amended as needed. Council members to provide one contact per County for media distribution. 12     Meeting Summary Upper Oconee Water Planning Council Meeting #3 September 15, 2009      5. Executive committee to assist Chair and Vice Chair in planning for future meetings.  12) Written Comments Submitted to Council In accordance with the Council’s request to receive written comments, several were submitted by the end of the meeting. The comments are recorded as written. Illegible words are noted with a question mark (?). Additional clarification of acronyms, jargon, etc. is noted by brackets [ ].  1. Jeff Knight – Athens-Clarke County Public Utilities Department Comments: GA EPD Letter (Memorandum) from Dr. Couch to Council Chairs Dated July 21, 2009 Regional Water Planning Process ‐  Councils have responsibility to develop draft regional water plan “The planning consultants are provided to assist with logistical, technical, and writing tasks as the direction of the Chair.” (Leadership Forum Meeting Summary, July 21, 2009, Pg 2 of 5) Question: Who are the planning consultants? Question: Are the planning consultants taking the collected data statistically analyzing the data and conducting necessary research methodology? Question: Is it the charge of the WPC to manage the water resources (basinwide) in such a manner as to force local governments to have to change water rate structures?  2. Bryan Tolar – Georgia Agribusiness Council Agricultural water use forecast is incomplete. This is a bigger issue in some regions than others. Of particular concern is the lack of inclusion of livestock production water use. Dairy and poultry production should be included. For example, the dairy industry estimates annual water use statewide for milk production to be in excess of 1.1 billion gallons just for drinking. Another 9.2 million are needed for cooling, which equates to more than 2.2 billion gallons per year in total. It has also been noted that nursery (horticulture) production is inaccurate and must be modified to have useful data moving forward. 13     Meeting Summary Upper Oconee Water Planning Council Meeting #3 September 15, 2009       3. Ben Emanuel – Georgia River Network RE: WPC Goals Public education on water conservation is an excellent goal. I would encourage the council to put as much emphasis on the distinct goal of water efficiency also, aimed more at policy-makers than at the general public. Improving efficiency in infrastructure and in plumbing throughout the public and private sectors goes beyond public education on conservation behaviors. 4. Ethan Armentrout – Armentrout Roebuck Matheny Consulting Group Comments/ Questions 1) GEFA [Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority] involvement may be helpful regarding rate structures, bond issuances, enterprise funds, etc. 2) It would help to have slides before meeting – even a day or 2. It would help to increase public involvement with process. 3) Include all maps too, especially to print out at larger sizes. 4) Please put link to Ag[riculture] stuff on website: ‘nespal (?) ag water demand’ won’t get people there. 5) Will “rules” (or procedure) change with the entire council speaking to press? – Previously chair was to represent council to press.  5. Dennis Holder – Council Member Need fees on withdrawals and fees on discharges. These fees will be used to monitor 303d streams and discharge points.
