Welcome and Introductions / Recap Council Meeting 1/Approve Agenda/EPD Process
Overview
Steve Simpson welcomed the council and thanked the council for their dedication and turned the
meeting over to Kristin Rowles. Kristin thanked all members for attending. Council chair
Donald Chase gave an invocation.
Kristin thanked Kip Purvis for providing the meeting facility. Frank Keller then provided a local
welcome.
Kristin asked if any members had any comments or edits to the Council Meeting 1 meeting
summary. There were no comments. Dick Morrow made a motion to approve the meeting
summary; the motion was seconded by Frank Keller. Don Chase asked for comments; the
meeting summary was approved by voice vote consensus with no dissent.
Kristin reviewed the agenda for the meeting and the goals for today’s meeting, which were the
following:
    1.  Review and approve (if possible) the MOA
    2.  Review population and employment forecasts and provide input
    3.  Overview Georgia agricultural water use
    4.  Introduce resource assessments -- purpose and approach
    5.  Continue to create a regional vision
Kristin asked if there were any objections to this agenda. There were no objections, and the
agenda was approved.

Meeting Date: June 26, 2009
Next, Tim Cash provided an overview of the planning process and its various components. His
presentation focused on how the Council will use the resource assessments and forecasts to
develop a water development and conservation plan. The slides for his presentation are available
on the Council website with the Council Meeting 2 (CM2) materials.
During the presentation, the following questions were asked:
      Brant Keller asked when the Council would establish a technical advisory committee and
       referenced the state water plan as providing for such a committee. Steve commented that
       the subcommittee makeup would be determined by the individual Councils. The state
       water plan provides for the creation of advisory committees as needed.
      Cliff Arnett mentioned to the Council that he had read a study that 97% of pollutant
       loading for the Chattahoochee River was from nonpoint sources. Tim said the graphics
       in the presentation were hypothetical and not actual.
      Kip Purvis said he thinks there is a general misconception from the public in that they
       think most of the pollution comes from point sources.
      Randall Starling asked if we had good data for the Upper Flint planning region. Tim said
       although we do not know yet since the resource assessments are not done, the purpose of
       the resource assessments will be to standardize data throughout Georgia.
      Frank Keller asked what the source of nonpoint source pollutant loading is north of the
       fall line where row crop agriculture is not significant. As an example, Tim said that any
       land disturbing activity could contribute to nonpoint source pollution.
      Donald Chase asked whether the slides were true projections of future conditions
       regarding capacity of our resources or just illustrative. Tim said the slides were
       hypothetical to illustrate the planning process.
      Cliff Arnett asked if the resource assessments will consider varying climatic conditions.
       Tim responded that they would.
      Cliff Arnett asked if the resource assessments will look at beneficial uses such as
       swimmable or fishable standards. Tim explained that each stream in the State of Georgia
       has a designated use. Assimilative capacity is determined based on this designated use,
       and therefore, the assessments will consider the designated uses. Randall asked what the
       designed use of stream in Upper Flint. Tim said there were many different uses
       designated for stream segments in the region.
Tim’s re-capped his presentation as follows:
    • Resource Assessments are being conducted by EPD, and they will establish the amount
       of water that is available to the region.
    • Forecasts being prepared by EPD and its partners will estimate the region’s future water
       needs.
    • The Regional Water Councils will use the resource assessments and forecasts to identify
       unmet future needs.
 MEETING SUMMARY                                                                                Page 3

Meeting Date: June 26, 2009
    • The Regional Water Councils will identify management practices that could be used to
        expand the capabilities of and/or reduce demand on their water resources.
    • The Regional Water Councils will recommend Regional Plans to EPD that includes those
        management practices.
    • EPD permit decisions will be guided by the Regional Plans.
MOA, Operating Procedures, and Rules for Meetings
Next, Kristin referred the Council to the documents that had been sent with feedback from GA
EPD on possible changes to the companion documents to the MOA. Kristin reminded the group
that while the MOA itself was not open for discussion, the companion documents (i.e., Operating
Procedures and Rules for Meetings), which are incorporated by references into the MOA, were
open to discussion. She noted that at the first meeting, this council discussed many issues but
did not provide definitive positions to EPD on what changes they would like to see. Therefore,
Kristin worked with the Chair and Vice-Chair in advance of this meeting to identify the possible
changes considered by GA EPD that were most relevant to this council’s discussion at Council
Meeting 1 (CM1).
Three hand-outs were distributed by e-mail this week, and hard copies were passed out at the
meeting:
     Desired Changes in MOA Companion Documents
     Operating Procedures (with possible changes noted)
     Rules for Meetings (with possible changes noted)
Kristin explained that the “Desired Changes” document listed possible changes that GA EPD had
already considered, after reviewing input and requests from all ten regional water councils.
Some changes were acceptable to GA EPD, while others were not. Those that were not
acceptable were highlighted, and alternatives were presented. The other two hand-outs reflect
the changes listed in the “Desired Changes” document. Kristin said, if there were no objections,
we would use the “Desired Changes” document to guide our discussion, but she noted that we
were not limited to what was listed there, if the members wished to consider other changes.
Kristin noted that the Council could adopt these documents today if they finalized them, and if not,
adoption of the MOA and related documents could proceed at CM 3. She reminded the Council
members that when they sign the MOA, they are doing so as individuals, not as representatives of
their organizations, and that signing the MOA was an acknowledgment of their agreement to
participate in the process.

Changes to the Operating Procedures
Section II: Quorum
The first change discussed was to define a quorum as 17 members. A Council member asked
whether alternates also counted as part of the quorum. Kristin said that alternates could be
counted toward the quorum, but if so, all alternates present would be included in the quorum.
After some discussion, Kristin asked if there was any objection defining a quorum as 17
members. There were no objections.
Section IV: Council Leadership
The next change discussed was to change the election of the Chair and Vice-Chair from two-
thirds vote to simple majority. Kristin noted that at CM1, many members had expressed an
interest in the use of simple majority instead of two-thirds majority, and that this was an issue
that we would take up in several places in this discussion. She also noted that the first Chair and
Vice-Chair were elected by simple majority at CM1. There were no questions or comments.
Kristin asked if there were any objections to this change. There were no objections.
The next change concerned setting the length of the terms for Chair and Vice-Chair, which were
six months in the original document. Several members had expressed concern that this was too
short at CM1, while it was acceptable to others. The proposed change would set the term so that
the initial term ended on December 31, 2009, and that subsequent terms would end at the end of
each calendar year. After Kristin explained this change, Kristin asked if there were any
objections. No objections were noted.
Section V: Decision Making
Kristin introduced possible changes to the decision making process. She noted that at CM1,
several members had expressed preferences for simple majority, but other preferred two-thirds
majority, as a fall-back when consensus could not be reached in a reasonable time period.
Council member Frank Keller asked about why the Council could not just follow Robert’s Rules
of Order. Kristin said that one of the possible changes addressed Robert’s Rules specifically.
She said that GA EPD wanted to demonstrate, where possible, broad agreement in decisions by
first attempting to get to consensus. GA EPD found the use of Robert’s Rules acceptable if the
decision-making preference for consensus, with a fallback voting procedure, was stated
explicitly. Then, Robert’s Rules could apply to all other situations.
First, the Council considered the following change: In the event that consensus on a decision
cannot be reached in a reasonable time period, specify that decisions will be made by a simple
majority vote rather than two-thirds majority. A couple members were concerned that voting by
simple majority did not promote consensus. Cliff Arnett noted his preference for two-thirds
majority. Randall Starling also expressed concern about simple majority instead of two-third
majority. Kristin introduced an alternative that GA EPD had found acceptable for another
council: Specify a process of sequential voting that provides for decision by a simple majority

Meeting Date: June 26, 2009
after two efforts to achieve two-thirds majority. Discussion followed. Then, a council member
made a motion that the Council use simple majority voting in the event that consensus could not
be reached after a reasonable amount of time. During discussion of the motion, Randall Starling
offered an alternative based on the sequential attempts approach that Kristin had mentioned (see
below), but the Council voted on the original motion first. Cliff Arnett raised a point of order:
what standard would apply to this motion – two-thirds or simple majority? The Council decided
to vote and see if they had a two-thirds majority. The motion did not pass: 13 votes favor, and
9 against.
Randall Starling had suggested that, in the event consensus could not be reached, the Council
could attempt a two-thirds majority vote at two different meetings and then fall back to a simple
majority vote if needed. Council member Buddy Leger was concerned about the length of time
to achieve this and council member Brant Keller was concerned with the tight deadline with
getting the plan passed. Kristin noted that meetings were scheduled to be quarterly. After some
discussion, a council member made a motion that the Council shall use the following decision-
making process: If consensus cannot be reached after a reasonable amount of time, the Council
may attempt to attain a two-thirds majority to approve a proposal. The Council may make two
attempts to attain a two-thirds majority on a proposal. Then, a simple majority vote may be
attempted to make the decision. The motion passed: 19 votes in favor and 3 against.
Kristin said she needed to undelete the definition of two thirds majority. There were no
objections.
Kristin also noted that a definition for simple majority should also be added. She said that some
of the original documents defined simple majority as 50% plus one and asked if this was clear
enough. A brief discussion followed about the clarity of this definition. An alternative was
suggested: “Simple Majority Vote – More than half of the Council members present at a
meeting.” References to “50% plus one” would be removed from the document and replaced
with this definition. This definition was adopted with no objections.
Kristin explained the next possible change in this section: Specify that, for decision-making
situations not specifically addressed in the operating procedures, Roberts Rules of Order will be
followed. The Council adopted this change with no objections.
Section VI: Meetings and Governance
The following four changes were noted and explained:
       Specify that advertisement of meeting will be by press release. The Council adopted this
        change with no objections.
 MEETING SUMMARY                                                                               Page 6

Meeting Date: June 26, 2009
     State that the regular meeting should be at least quarterly or more frequently, if needed
         and called by the Chair. The Council adopted this change with no objections.
        Specify that meeting summaries shall capture dissent to the extent that dissent is formally
         noted during the meeting. The Council adopted this change with no objections.
        Specify that, if a quorum is not present a majority of those present may choose to meet
         and discuss issues, but may not take any actions. The Council adopted this change with
         no objections.
Kristin explained the next possible change: Specify that the Chair has the authority to appoint
subcommittees. Council member Brant Keller raised a concern that we need to review the
statewide water plan to ensure that we are consistent. His concern related to the establishment of
advisory committees, as noted in the statewide plan, but he also noted a broad concern for the
need for this and other Councils to be consistent with the provisions of the statewide water plan.
The MOA and its companion documents reference the statewide water plan, but do not explicitly
require consistency. Discussion about Brant’s concern followed.
Steve mentioned that GAEPD has begun the process of establishing the Local Government
Advisory Body with the distribution of an invitation letter with the Population and Employment
Input DVD that was sent out last month. It was noted that changing the documents of other
councils was not within our purview and that changes could be made if needed at a later time.
Lamar Perlis asked who had the authority to approve changes to MOA and to the Water
Development and Conservation Plans. Tim noted that the parties signing the MOA documents
included GA EPD, GA Department of Community Affairs, and the Council, and that GAEPD
had a role to ensure level playing field and some consistency for all 10 regional councils. Steve
referenced the statewide water plan which notes that the Water Development and Conservation
Plan is to be submitted to the Director of GAEPD, who reviews the plan and determines whether
it will be adopted, modified, or rejected.
Vice-Chairman Dick Morrow made a motion that the Council should express concern to GAEPD
that the Operating Procedures do not specify adherence to the State Water Plan. The motion
passed: 20 votes in favor with no dissent and 2 abstentions.
Kristin returned the discussion to the change concerned the chairman having the authority to
appoint subcommittees. The Council adopted this change with no objections.
 Next, the Council considered the following change: Specify that the Chair shall be responsible
for directing participation by nonmembers. After some discussion, several Council members
suggested changing “directing” to “guiding”. Kristin asked if there were any objections to
adopting the modified language. There were no objections.
 MEETING SUMMARY                                                                              Page 7

Meeting Date: June 26, 2009
Kristin explained there was a change recommended by EPD/DCA to clarify language on
resignations. This revised the first sentence of the paragraph on resignations as follows “Any
Chair, Vice Chair or Member may resign at any time by submitting a resignation in writing to the
Director of EPD, who will notify the appointing officials.” The Council adopted this change
with no objections.
Section VIII: Amendments
The next change considered was: Specify that the Council Operating Procedures and Rules for
Meeting be amended by a simple majority rather than a two-thirds majority. The Council
discussed this change relative to the decision making changes already adopted. Kristin suggested
that the modified decision making section could be referenced here and those procedures applied
to decisions about amendments. One member asked that the decision-making procedure
language be repeated here, rather than referenced. The revised text will read as follows (1st two
sentences of Section VIII): These operating procedures and the Council’s Rules for Meetings
shall be reviewed annually. After EPD review and comment, the procedures may be altered,
amended, or replaced by new operating procedures by a simple majority vote following two
attempts at the same meeting to achieve a decision by a two thirds majority vote of the Upper
Flint Water Planning Council members. The Council adopted this change with no objections.
A Council Member was concerned that there was no method for members to call a meeting; only
the Chair could call a meeting. Chairman Donald Chase offered an amendment to modify the
first sentence under Regular Meetings in Section VI: Meetings and Governance: “A regular
meeting of the Upper Flint Water Planning Council shall be held at least quarterly, or more
frequently if needed and called by the Chair or by 13 voting members of the Council.” The
Council voted on this change, and it was adopted: 21 votes in favor, 1 against. The dissenting
voter was concerned that it would not be clear who would run the meeting if the Chair did not
agree to the meeting, but the Chair noted that he believed that the Chair would still be expected
to participate.
The Council members voted on approving the Operating Procedures, as amended. The motion
passed: 22 votes favor, 0 against.
Kristin then asked that the Council take a break, conduct the Population and Employment
Forecast discussion after the break, and complete the discussion of the MOA and companion
documents after lunch, in order to accommodate those who would be joining us by phone for the
Population and Employment Forecast discussion.

Meeting Date: June 26, 2009
Population and Employment Forecast
For the discussion of the population and employment forecasts, David Tanner (Office of
Planning & Budget (OPB)), Dr. Warren Brown (Carl Vinson Institute Government Applied
Demography Program), Dr. Jeffrey Dorfman (UGA Department of Agricultural and Applied
Economics) joined the meeting by telephone. Dr. Brown and Dr. Dorfman led the development
of the population and employment forecasts.
David Tanner thanked the group for this opportunity and explained how the Office of Planning
& Budget contracted with Carl Vinson Institute to assist with this effort to ensure projections
were as good as possible. Warren Brown introduced himself, stressed these estimates are
preliminary, and encouraged comments. Jeff Dorfman introduced himself as well.
Kristin stated that the comment period on the forecasts is open until June 30th. She reminded
members to contact local government officials that might be interested in comments on the
population and employment forecasts. Thus far, only a handful of comments have been received
from this region.
Kristin noted that the population and employment forecasts would be used to project the future
demand for water for municipal and industrial water uses. She presented slides (included on the
council website with the CM2 meeting materials) that described the types of input that was needed to
finalize the estimates and that presented the estimates, statewide and in the region. Hand-outs of
county level data on population projections and industry specific data on employment projections for
the region were passed out.
A member asked about how to comment on the forecasts. Kristin explained that this can be done
online at www.georgiawaterplanning.org/pe. She reminded them that comments are due on
Tuesday, June 30.
Council members asked the following questions and made the following comments to Warren,
Jeff, and David:
        Vice Chairman Dick Morrow said he took exception to the Spalding County forecasts.
         He noted four factors that would substantially affect population and employment in the
         county in the near term, including: (1) spillover from rapid growth in neighboring
         counties, (2) the development of Sun City, a retirement community with over 3400
         homes, (3) continued growth of the UGA-Griffin campus; 9000 more students are
         expected, and (4) development of an industrial park. Dick noted that the Sun City
         development alone will surpass the project 40-year growth for the county in the next
         decade. Warren said Spalding County was at his top of his list as far as numbers that
         need to be revised. Warren encouraged Dick to officially provide this input.
 MEETING SUMMARY                                                                                  Page 9

Meeting Date: June 26, 2009
      Cliff Arnett asked why they used a Texas model and what was the margin of error for the
         forecasts? Warren said while the model was based on model methodology used in Texas
         (which, like Georgia, is a large, rapidly growing state), it uses only Georgia data. For
         the population projects, the model used is not a probability model, and therefore it does
         not have a margin of error. Instead, they are preparing high/medium/low series of
         forecasts. Jeff Dorfman said that for the employment forecasts, he is still pinning down
         an exact margin of error, but estimates it in at least the 5-6% range.
        One member asked whether or not the forecasts used data from the RDCs. He noted that
         these Pike County forecasts were quite different from the forecasts prepared by the
         McIntosh Trail RDC. Jeff noted that they have involved the RDCs through the advisory
         council and used input from the RDCs to make adjustments.
        Michael Donnelly asked why the population forecast dips down in 2040. Dr. Brown
         explained that this dip was the result of stitching together modeling methods for beyond
         2040. He noted that the revisions to the population and employment forecasts will
         eliminate the dip at 2040.
  Kip Purvis noted that Merriwether County had developed infrastructure in the northern part of
 the county to attract industry and had been fairly successful to date. He said that metro Atlanta
and Columbus development are reaching Merriwether County, and he did not think that forecasts
  captured that impact. Warren said that one weakness of their approach is in predicting future
   spillover development and growth. He noted that Merriwether has increased since the 2000
                                                 census.
William Culpepper commented that the development of an inland port in Crisp County is
projected to increase jobs by 3000-5000 in the county. Lamar Perlis and Buddy Leger confirmed
the importance of this proposed development to future growth in Crisp County. They were
encouraged to submit comments on this development.
Dick Morrow said that undercounting was a significant problem in Georgia in the 2000 census.
Warren said he had worked a lot in New York State on census issues, including challenging
census estimates. He noted the importance of involvement in the census process.
One member asked how the census counts transient populations, such as tourists, college
students, and military. Warren responded that the current place of residence determines where
one is counted, so the population estimates capture college students (living in a college town),
but do not include tourists.
Kristin thanked Warren, Jeff, and David for joining the council meeting. Warren reminded the
group to submit comments by June 30. He also announced a series of regional workshops in the
fall to collect input that will assist them as these forecasts are revised in the future. Kristin told

The Council broke for lunch.
MOA, Operating Procedures, and Rules for Meetings (After Lunch)
After lunch, Kristin revisited the meeting goals to remind members what had been covered so far
and what items remained. Then she returned the discussion to the MOA companion documents
and turned to possible changes in the Rules for Meetings document.
Rule 2: Meeting Roles and Rule 3: Communications
The first change considered affected communications with the media:
     In Rule 2, paragraph E, delete the statement that the EPD representative is available to
         talk to the media.
     In Rule 3, add a paragraph 8 stating that media communications will be coordinated
         between the Chair and the EPD representative.
Kristin said that in a previous meeting, another council had discussed what it meant to coordinate
on media communications, and that after discussion with the EPD representative, it was clarified
that it did not mean getting prior permission, but rather keeping each other informed about media
communications. The Council adopted this change with no objections.
Rule 4: Meeting agenda and summaries
Next, the Council considered the following change: Specify that agenda will be available
electronically ten days in advance of each regularly scheduled meeting. One member asked that
the word “business” be inserted in between “ten” and “days”. The Council adopted this change,
as modified, with no objections.
Rule 6: Decision making
The next change considered was: Specify that votes shall be by show of hands. Discussion
regarding the election of Chair and Vice-Chair followed. It was recommended that the Council
use written ballots for the election of the Chair and Vice-Chair. The Council adopted the
following language with no objections for the second sentence in paragraph I: “All votes shall
be by show of hands, with the exception of the election of the Chair and Vice-Chair, which
shall be by written ballot.”
Next, the Council considered how to make this section consistent with prior changes affecting
Decision making. For paragraph I, the text will be modified to read: When voting on a proposal,
approval by a simple majority following two attempts in the same meeting to achieve approval
by a two-thirds vote is required for its acceptance. This change will make paragraph I consistent
with the revised decision making process described in Section V of the Operating Procedures.
Paragraph K will be added as follows: “K. For all-decision making not specifically addressed in
the Operating Procedures or the Rules for Meetings, Robert’s Rules of Order will be followed.”
 MEETING SUMMARY                                                                             Page 11

Meeting Date: June 26, 2009
One member noted that the documents should specify a specific version of Robert’s Rules, to be
selected by the planning contractors. These changes were adopted by the Council, with the
addition of the version reference for Robert’s Rules, without objection.
Dick Morrow made a motion to approve the Rules for Meetings; the motion was seconded by
Beth English. Don Chase asked for discussion, and then called for a vote. The motion passed:
23 votes favor, 0 against.
Kristin noted that the changes would be sent to GAEPD for review and that the Council could
take up signing the MOA at its next meeting.
Introduction to Agriculture Water Demand Forecasts
Mark Masters from the Georgia Water Planning and Policy Center provided an introduction to
the agricultural water demand forecasts, which will be presented at CM3. His slides will be
available on the council website with materials from CM2.
Mark’s presentation included an overview of crops, associated water usage, irrigated amounts,
types of irrigation equipment, seasonal patterns of irrigation, changes over time, and trends.
The Council Members had the following questions:
       Dick Morrow asked how agricultural acreage had changed in the last fifty years. Mark
        said that the total land devoted to agriculture has diminished, while agricultural yield
        and individual farm size has increased.
       Cliff Arnett asked how consumptive agricultural water use is. Mark said that there are
        ongoing studies to estimate this better, but currently, the State of Georgia considers
        agriculture 100 percent consumptive for planning purposes.
       Dick Morrow referred to saltwater intrusion problems in the Ogallala aquifer and asked if
        aquifers have similar problems. Mark responded that in Georgia, saltwater intrusion is a
        problem in the Floridan aquifer only in the Savannah/Hilton Head area, where
        agriculture is not the primary user. He said that the Ogallala is a confined aquifer which
        takes a long time to recharge, while the Floridan in Southwest Georgia recharges
        quickly. With the Florida, inter-connectedness with the surface water leads to a different
        set of concerns, especially for endangered species. In Georgia, the Clayton aquifer is
        confined, and there is a moratorium on pumping. However, Mark said that the bulk of
        groundwater use for agriculture in Georgia is from the Floridan aquifer. Mark said that
        to the east of our region, in Tift and Worth counties, there is some concern about over-

Meeting Date: June 26, 2009
        pumping in the Floridan aquifer, and this concern is being assessed by the state as a part
        of the resource assessment process.
       One member asked if there was significant pumping for bottled water in the region. Mark
        thought this use was not substantial and noted that he knew of only one such operation
        (i.e., Nantze Springs).
Introduction to Resource Assessments
Kristin noted that so far today, we had talked about the forecasts that would be used to determine
the region’s future water needs. Now, we would shift to focus on how we would be assessing the
region’s water resources capacity to meet those needs with an overview of the resource
assessments and the use of modeling in those assessments. Steve Simpson reviewed an
introduction to modeling, types of models, and the use of modeling for the resource assessments
pertaining to the statewide water planning effort. He provided an introduction to the development
of the resource assessments, which will serve as the basis for determining the status and capacity
of the region’s water resources. The slides from the modeling and introductory resource
assessment presentation will be available on the council website with materials from CM2.
The Council Members had the following questions:
       Cliff Arnett asked how a baseline is being established for the assessments. Steve said
        EPD is going to use existing data to develop a baseline and build the models.
       Brant Keller asked if there had been a general call for data. Steve said no.
       Cliff Arnett brought to the attention of the Council some correspondence he had with
        Brian Hughes of USGS concerning their data for this region. USGS has a report, Water
        Availability for Ecological Needs in Flint River Basin, GA. Tim noted that GAEPD
        should have this data.
       Cliff Arnett said he would like for the Council to get a list of TMDLs in the region. Steve
        said we could supply that list. Kristin noted that at CM3, we would be talking about 319
        (nonpoint source) and TMDL projects in the region.
       Brant Keller asked how much time the Council would have to review the resource
        assessments and whether the Council would be able to have input. Steve answered that
        he expected the review process would be similar to that we are now going through for the
        population and employment forecasts.

Meeting Date: June 26, 2009
      Council member Lamar Perlis asked where he could find this presentation. Steve
         answered that it will be uploaded to: www.georgiawaterplanning.org
        Dick Morrow asked whether better water quality would lead to better assimilative
         capacity. Steve answered yes.
Creating a Regional Vision
Kristin presented some slides to describe the development of a regional vision to guide the Council in
the development of the regional water plan. (These slides are included on the council’s website with
materials for CM2.) She referred to the vision for the statewide water plan: Georgia manages water
resources in a sustainable manner to:
            1. Support the state’s economy
            2. Protect public health and natural systems
            3. Enhance the quality of life for all citizens
She said that the Council’s vision would describe how the statewide vision applies in this region. The
vision would help in the development of goals for the regional water plan and in the selection of
management practices, in combination with the resource assessments and water use demand
forecasts.
She said that at the next meeting, we would work to develop a shared vision for the Council, and that
before that, the Council members should think about their individual ideas for the vision. She passed
out two hand-outs. The first is a summary of the Council’s discussion of trends, forces, and factors
affecting water resources in the region at CM1. This summary is to serve as a reference as they
consider their ideas about the vision.
The second hand-out describes a “homework” assignment to prepare for the vision discussion at the
next council meeting. Overall, the hand-out asks Council members to list their ideas in response to
the following question: What do you want your rivers, lakes and groundwater to do for you and the
citizens in your planning region?
Kristin said that she would send these documents to the Council again, electronically, at a time
closer to the meeting, to remind them to complete this exercise before CM3.
Council member Dick Morrow commented all visions come with a cost and urged members to
consider the need to temper our visions based on economic conditions.
One member asked about the recent designation of the Flint River as an “endangered” river.
Kristin explained that a national environmental organization had recently identified the Flint
River on its annual list of the ten most endangered rivers in the country. Brant Keller noted that
this listing was related to Atlanta’s interest in building a dam on the Flint River. He said the

Meeting Date: June 26, 2009
Atlanta Regional Commission had made such a proposal. (See further discussion under public
comment below.)
Kip Purvis said that the “elephant in the room” is Atlanta. He said he thought growth should go
where the resources are.
Public Involvement Plan
Kristin said that GAEPD will soon issue a public involvement plan template for finalization by
the regional water planning councils. She presented a few slides (available on the Council
website) that reviewed the goals and process for the public involvement plan.
The public involvement plan will provide the opportunity for stakeholder participation from the
local government advisory body, other regional water planning councils, and the public during
the regional water planning process. Public involvement will be provided for at each of the
Council’s meetings (minimum quarterly) through comment periods for local government
officials and the public at each meeting. Public involvement will also include interacting with
neighboring councils with which this region shares water resources. This will occur in part
through joint council meetings. In the event of conflict between regional water planning
councils, dispute resolution procedures will be outlined in the technical planning guidance,
which will be provided by GAEPD. After GAEPD issues a draft public involvement plan, the
regional councils will finalize and implement it. This will be on the CM3 agenda.
Next, Kristin read a list of items on the CM3 agenda:
    • Visioning
    • Resource Assessments
    • Joint Meetings
    • Public Involvement Plan
    • MOA Execution
    • Regulatory Process Primer
    • Regional Geography (319 and TMDL examples for region)
    • Agricultural Water Use Forecasts
    • Municipal & Industrial Forecasting Methodology
    • Management Practices Overview

Meeting Date: June 26, 2009
Local Elected Officials and Public Comments
Next, the Council provided time for local elected officials and the general public to address the
council. No elected officials spoke. One public commenter spoke:
Shana Udvaardy, Georgia Conservancy: Ms. Udvaardy introduced herself as the Water Program
manager and described her organization. She highlighted some of the Georgia Conservancy’s
issues of concern, which include air, water, growth, and recreation. She clarified that it was the
American Rivers organization that had identified the Flint River as endangered. She said
concern arose not only from the Atlanta Regional Commission’s interest in a dam on the Flint
River, but when two U.S. Congressmen proposed discussions about a dam on the Flint River.
She encouraged those with questions about this issue to contact the new Flint Riverkeeper, Paul
Deloach. Ms. Udvaardy stated the Georgia Conservancy’s vision for water was for clean and
abundant drinking water, and noted that it is important to her organization that water is kept in its
basin of origin and that downstream flows are maintained. She said that efficiency is one of the
most environmental and economic means of water management. She noted the importance of
the connection between energy use and water use. She said that water conservation is a much
less expensive way to get water than to build a reservoir. With respect to the public
involvement plan, Ms. Udvaardy said that she would like to see that the Council offer the
opportunity for public comment prior to decision-making on an issue.
After Ms. Udvaardy’s comments, Cliff Arnett said that he felt it was important that the Council
meet with the Atlanta Regional Commission if it has plans for the Flint River. Tim Cash said
that the final plan of the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District (Metro District),
which is staffed by the Atlanta Regional Commission, did not include a dam on the Flint River.
Kristin offered to send a link to the plans of the Metro District. Tim said that the website did not
yet have the final plans posted, but it would soon.
One member made a motion that the Council should have the Metro District come to meeting to
and provide the Council with an update on its plans. Steve indicated that an overview of the
Metro District plans for the Council was currently being developed. The Council approved this
motion with no objections.
Wrap-Up and What to Expect Next Meeting
Kristin had already reviewed the list of items that would be on the agenda for CM3 (see above),
and the Council noted the addition of a presentation from the Metro District. Next, the Council
selected dates and locations for its next two meetings:
September 22 – Weyerhauser, Oglethorpe, GA
