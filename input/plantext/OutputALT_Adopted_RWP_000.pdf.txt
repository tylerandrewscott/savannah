EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 



Executive Summary 
Executive Summary 
Introduction and Overview of the Altamaha Region 
Of all Georgia’s natural resources, none is more important to the future of our State than water. Over the last several decades, Georgia has been one of the fastest growing states in the nation. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, between 2000 and 
4th
2010, Georgia ranked in total population gain (1.5 million new residents) and 7th in percentage increase in population (18%). During a portion of this same period, our State also experienced unprecedented drought. Georgia’s growth and economic prosperity are vitally linked to our water resources. 
As our State has grown, the management and value of water resources has also changed. Ensuring a bright future for our State requires thoughtful planning and wise use of our water resources. In 2008, the State of Georgia’s leadership authorized a comprehensive state-wide water planning process to help address these challenges and take a forward look at how our State is expected to grow and use water over the next 40 years. The Altamaha Regional Water Planning Council (Altamaha Council) was established in February 2009 as part of this state­wide process. The Altamaha Council is one of 11 planning regions charged with developing Regional Water Plans, and encompasses sixteen counties in the south central portion of Georgia (shown in Figure ES-1). An overview of the initial findings and recommendations for the Altamaha Region are provided in this Executive Summary. The Altamaha Council’s Regional Water Plan is available at: www.altamahacouncil.org. 
Water Resource Trends and Key Findings for the Altamaha Region  
The Altamaha Region includes 16 counties in the  
south central portion of Georgia. Over the next 40 years, the population of the region is projected to increase from approximately 250,000 to 375,000 residents. Key economic drivers in the region include agriculture, forestry, professional and business services, education, healthcare, manufacturing, public administration, fishing and hunting, and construction. Energy production is also significant to the region. Water supplies, wastewater treatment, and related infrastructure will need to be developed and maintained to support these economic drivers. Groundwater from the Upper Floridan Aquifer is needed to meet about 55% of the water supply needs, with agricultural and industrial uses being the dominant demand sectors. Surface water is utilized to meet about 45% of the water supply needs, with agriculture and energy as the dominant demand sectors. The energy sector is a major user of surface water from the Altamaha River. Water resource challenges in the region include: surface water shortfalls during some periods on the Canoochee, Ogeechee, Alapaha, and Satilla Rivers; and water quality challenges associated with low dissolved oxygen in some portions of the region.  Management practices are needed to address these challenges including: water conservation; refining planning information; alternate sources of supply in areas where surface water availability may be limited; improving/upgrading wastewater treatment; and addressing non-point sources of pollution.

Georgia has abundant water resources, with 14 major river systems and multiple groundwater aquifer systems. These waters are shared natural resources; streams and rivers run through many political jurisdictions. The rain that falls in one region of Georgia may replenish the aquifers used by communities many miles away. And, while water in Georgia is abundant, it is not an unlimited resource. It must be carefully managed to meet long-term water needs. Since water resources vary greatly across the State, water supply planning on a regional and local level is the most effective way to ensure that current and future water resource needs are met.  
The Altamaha River, formed by the confluence of the Ocmulgee and Oconee Rivers, is the major surface water feature in the region. The river originates in the Northern Piedmont province of north Georgia, traverses southeast through the Coastal Plain region, and discharges to the Atlantic Ocean near Darien, Georgia. It is the only major river in Georgia that is contained wholly within the boundaries of the State. The Altamaha River is a popular fishing resource to the region and is home to 74 species of fish including sunfish, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and catfish. 
The Altamaha Region encompasses several major population centers, including Vidalia, Jesup, Swainsboro, Eastman, and Glennville. The Altamaha Region is projected to grow by approximately 61,000 residents, or 24%, from 2010 to 2030 (Georgia’s Office of Planning and Budget, 2010). Based on this trend, the population of the region in 2050 will increase by approximately 124,000 people, or 49%, for a total of about 375,000 residents. To accommodate this growth, the region requires reliable water supplies and sufficient wastewater treatment to meet its growing needs. In addition, the region has a vibrant agricultural base that requires water supply to continue supporting the economics of the region. 
Key economic drivers in the Altamaha Region include agriculture, forestry, professional and business services, education, healthcare, manufacturing, public administration, fishing and hunting, and construction. The important industrial and 
ES-2 September 2011 

manufacturing sectors in the region include mining, food, textile, paper, chemical, petroleum, rubber, stone and clay, primary metals, fabricated metals, and electrical equipment. Forested lands and agriculture are major land covers in the region, which are also important drivers for the region’s economy. 
Establishing a Water Resource Vision for the Altamaha Region 
A foundational part of the water planning process was the development of a vision for the region that describes the economic, population, environmental, and water use conditions that are desired for the region. The Altamaha Council adopted the following vision for the region. 
“The vision of the Altamaha Regional Water Planning Council is to wisely manage, develop, and protect the region’s water resources for current and future generations by ensuring that the Altamaha basin’s water resources are sustainably managed to enhance quality of life and public health, protect natural systems including fishing, wildlife and wildlife utilization activities, and support the basin’s economy.” 
The Altamaha Council identified 12 goals to complement the vision. These goals can be found in Section 1 of the Regional Water Plan.  
Overview of Water Resources and Use in the Altamaha Region 
Surface Water 
The Altamaha River is the major surface water feature in the region. The Altamaha River, formed by the confluence of the Ocmulgee and Oconee Rivers, is 127 miles long and has a drainage area of approximately 14,000 square miles (EPD, 2003). As shown in Figure ES-2, surface water is used to meet about 45% of the region’s water supply needs. Through 2050, the sources of agricultural surface water in the region are projected to come from the Altamaha River Basin (34-36%), Ocmulgee River Basin (28-29%), Ogeechee River Basin (21%), Satilla River Basin (7-8%), Suwannee River Basin (6%), and Oconee River Basin (2%). This information is based on the assumption that future use will follow current practices and trends. However, as described in more detail below, there are some locations where current and/or future water needs exceed water availability, which causes the need to develop alternate sources of water supply.

Groundwater 
As shown in Figure ES-2, groundwater is used to meet about 55% of the region’s water supply needs. Based on 2010 forecasted groundwater withdrawal data, approximately 94% of groundwater in the region will be supplied from the Floridan aquifer, which is one of the most productive groundwater aquifers in the United States. The remaining groundwater is supplied by the surficial, Claiborne, Gordon, Cretaceous, and Dublin aquifers. 
Water and Wastewater Needs in the Altamaha Region – A Closer Look 
Figure ES-3 presents surface water and groundwater use by sector in the Altamaha Region. About 54% percent of surface water withdrawals in the region are for the energy sector. However, only approximately 36 MGD of the total 58 MGD of energy water withdrawals is consumed, while the remaining 22 MGD are returned to the surface water. About 105 MGD of groundwater withdrawals are used to supply industrial (48%) and agricultural uses (33%), while municipal, self-supply (homes with groundwater wells), and energy make up the remaining uses. 

Wastewater treatment types/values representing past trends and forecasted use in the region are shown in Figure ES-4. According to the Altamaha Water and Wastewater Forecast developed for the Regional Water Plan (CDM, 2011), 62% of treated wastewater in the region are disposed of as a municipal/industrial point source discharge, energy discharge (20%), or to a land application system (5%). The remaining wastewater is treated by on-site sewage treatment (septic) systems (13%).

Altamaha Forecasted Water Resource Needs from the Year 2010 to 2050 
Municipal water and wastewater forecasts are tied to population projections for the counties within the Altamaha Region. The population projections were developed by the Georgia Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget and are shown in Figure ES-5. Overall, the region’s water supply needs are expected to grow by 34% (90 MGD) from 2010 through 2050. Over the same period, total wastewater flows in the region are expected to grow by 34% (36 MGD).

Comparison of Available Resource Capacity to Future Water Resource Needs 
Groundwater Availability 
Groundwater from the Upper Floridan Aquifer is a vital resource for the Altamaha Region. Several groundwater modeling tools were developed as part of the water planning process to estimate the amount of water that can be sustainably pumped from select regional aquifers; also referred to as sustainable yield. Overall, the results from the Groundwater Availability Resource Assessment (EPD, March 2010) indicate that the sustainable yield for the modeled portions of the regional aquifer(s) is greater than the forecasted demands. Therefore, at this time no groundwater resource shortfalls are expected to occur in the Altamaha Region over the 40 year planning horizon. However, localized issues could arise in areas where there is a high well density and/or high volumes of groundwater withdrawal. 

Surface Water Availability 
Surface water is also an important resource used to meet current and forecasted future needs of the Altamaha Region. In order to determine if there is sufficient surface water to meet both off­stream uses of water and instream flow needs, a Surface Water Availability Resource Assessment model was developed and used in the state water planning process. 
The results of the future conditions modeling from the Surface Water Availability Resource Assessment (EPD, March 2010) show that in some portions of the region, there are sufficient surface water supplies to meet current and forecasted water supply needs. However, in dry years, during some portions of the year, the modeled demand for off­stream uses of water results in projected impacts to
ES-6 September 2011 

Executive Summary 
instream flow needs (referred to as a “gap”). Figure ES-6 summarizes the locations in or near the region where there is a forecasted gap between available surface water resource and forecasted need. There are current and 2050 forecasted surface water gaps at the following locations in and near the region: Claxton (Canoochee River), Eden (Ogeechee River, outside of Altamaha Region), Kings Ferry (Ogeechee River, outside of Altamaha Region), Atkinson (Satilla River, outside of Altamaha Region) and Statenville (Alapaha River outside of the Altamaha Region). At each of these locations, the dominant water use type is agricultural. The projected increase of agricultural surface water use for the counties within the Altamaha Region that have current and/or future gaps is 5.32 MGD. Since there are current gaps at the referenced locations, it will be difficult to develop additional surface water to meet projected needs without increasing current gaps. As described below, management practices are recommended by the Altamaha Council to address surface water gaps. In Figure ES-6, the terms “planning node” and “basic node” refer to locations in the region with long-term river flow measurement data. In most instances, basic nodes are located at or near 
U.S. Geological Survey stream gages or at dams. Planning nodes are basic nodes where water availability assessments are performed. 
Assessment of Water Quality Conditions 
Summary of Resource Assessment Results  

Management Practices should be developed and implemented to address water resource shortfalls as determined by the three Resource Assessments.  Groundwater: Overall, results indicate that the sustainable yield for the modeled portions of the regional aquifer(s) is greater than the forecasted demands.  Surface Water Quantity: There are sufficient surface water supplies at some locations throughout the Altamaha Region, but there are also projected surface water shortfalls at the Claxton, Eden, Kings Ferry, Atkinson, and Statenville nodes. Surface Water Quality: There are four river reaches within the Ogeechee River Basin, six river reaches within the Altamaha River Basin, and one river reach in the Ocmulgee River Basin that may exceed assimilative capacity.  

One measure of the capacity of surface water to maintain its health and the health of the aquatic species living therein is the amount of residual dissolved oxygen in the water. As part of the March 2010 Surface Water Quality (Assimilative Capacity) Resource Assessment, modeling of dissolved oxygen concentrations was performed by EPD for each surface water reach in the region that has upstream wastewater discharges to the reach. The modeling estimates the ability of the surface water to assimilate the amount of waste being discharged (also referred to as assimilative capacity). Each modeled river segment was classified as exceeding dissolved oxygen capacity, meeting dissolved oxygen capacity, or having available dissolved oxygen capacity. Table ES-1 summarizes the results of the assimilative capacity assessment for dissolved oxygen at baseline and/or permitted conditions including recommendations to address potential future (2050) water quality needs. Assimilative capacity assessments indicate the potential need for improved

wastewater treatment in some facilities within the Ogeechee, Altamaha, and Ocmulgee River Basins. Information is also included for portions of the river basin where additional treatment of nitrogen and/or phosphorus and/or ammonia may be needed.

Under Section 303d of the federal Clean Water Act, a total maximum daily load must be developed for waters that do not meet their designated uses. A total maximum daily load represents the maximum pollutant loading that a water body can assimilate and continue meeting its designated use (i.e., not exceeding State water quality standards). A water body is deemed to be impaired if it does not meet the applicable criteria for a particular pollutant; consequently, total maximum daily loads are required to be established for these waters to reduce the concentrations of the exceeding parameters in order to comply with State water quality standards. 
For the Altamaha Region, there are 75 impaired stream reaches (total impaired length of 915 miles) and 2 impaired lakes (total impaired area of 390 acres). Total 
ES-8 September 2011 

Executive Summary 
maximum daily loads have been completed for 71 of the impaired stream reaches and for both of the impaired lakes. The majority of impairments are due to low dissolved oxygen and fecal coliform. 
Identifying Water Management Practices to Address Water Resource Shortfalls and Future Needs 
The comparison of EPD’s March 2010 Resource Assessments and forecasted demands identified the region’s likely resource shortfalls or gaps and demonstrated the necessity for region and resource specific water management practices. In selecting the actions needed (i.e., water management practices), the Altamaha Council considered practices identified in existing plans, the Region’s Vision and Goals, and coordinated with local governments and water providers as well as neighboring Councils that share these water resources. 
The Altamaha Council has developed a management practice strategy based on the best data and modeling results available. The Council recognizes that as data are refined and modeling results improve – including water and wastewater projections and Resource Assessments – the resulting future needs and gaps may change. Therefore, the Council has prioritized short-term management practices to address gaps with the understanding that more complex management practices may be required in the future. These short-term management practices are presented in Tables ES-2 and ES-3. 
The Altamaha Council believes the Regional Water Plan should be reviewed in defined increments in the future such as every five years to evaluate how the implemented management practices are performing toward addressing gaps and meeting forecasted needs and what additional measures might be required. If the selected management practices have not sufficiently closed the gaps identified by the Resource Assessments, then additional management practices should be selected and implemented. The selected management practices will over time address identified gaps and meet future uses when combined with practices for all shared resource regions.

Implementing Water Management Practices 
The Altamaha Council supports the concept of regional water resource planning with a focus on planning Councils composed of local governments, water users, water providers, industry, business and affected stakeholders. Local representatives are typically most familiar with local water resource issues and needs. The State has a vital role providing technical support, guidance, and funding to support locally focused water resource planning. This plan should be viewed as a living, iterative document and the State should focus on the following principles: 
Education, Incentives, Collaboration, Cooperation, Enabling, Supporting 
Implementation of the Altamaha Regional Water Plan will be primarily by various water users and wastewater utilities in the region. The most cost-effective and more readily implemented management practices will be prioritized for short-term implementation via an incremental and adaptive approach as shown in Figure ES-7. If resource needs are not met and/or gaps are not addressed, then more complex management practices will be pursued. Future planning efforts should confirm current assumptions and make necessary revisions and/or improvements to the conclusions reached during this round of planning. 
ES-10 September 2011 

Cost Considerations 
Planning level cost estimates were prepared for the various categories of management practices. A detailed summary of costs can be found in Section 7 of the Regional Water Plan. In most cases, costs are presented on a unit cost basis or when applicable as a total estimated cost for certain management practices. Total overall costs for the entire Plan were not specifically developed because the recommended practices are not intended to be mandated or prescriptive to the water and wastewater users and providers. In general, addressing surface water needs in the region from both a water supply and a water quality perspective are expected to present the largest challenges and have the most fiscal impact. For the Regional Water Plan to be most effective, wastewater utilities and agricultural water users will need the planning and implementation support to help them meet current and future needs. It is anticipated that several different funding sources and options will be used to secure funding for the various management practices outlined in the Regional Water Plan, and adequate funding will be a critical component of the successful implementation of the State Water Plan.  
Implementation Considerations and Benchmarks – Helping Ensure Progress toward Meeting Future Needs 
Effective implementation of the Regional Water Plan will require the availability of sufficient funding in the form of loans, and in some cases, possibly grants. In addition, many of the proposed management practices require ongoing coordination with affected stakeholders/water users and collaboration to help ensure successful solutions are identified and implemented. Finally, in many cases, monitoring progress toward addressing future needs will require improved data and information on the current actions and management practices that are already in place. 
To assess progress toward meeting regional needs, the Altamaha Council identified several benchmarks, which can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
ALTAMAHA 

September 2011 ES-11 

Executive Summary 
Regional Water Plan. The benchmarks are discussed in Section 8 of the Regional Water Plan and include both the activities that should be accomplished and the measurement tools that can be used to assess progress. 
The Altamaha Council suggests that EPD consider “institutionalizing” planning. This would entail a long-term commitment of staff and funding to: monitor and support Regional Water Plan recommendations; coordinate improved data collection, management and analysis; continue to develop and improve Resource Assessment tools; and help provide funding, permitting, and technical support to address gaps and water resource needs. Institutionalized planning would provide the framework to monitor management practice progress against the benchmarks presented, assist in determining the success of implemented programs, and evaluate what additional practices might be necessary. 
The Altamaha Council supports the concept of regional water planning led by local representatives. The Council members wish to express their gratitude to former Governor Sonny Perdue, Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle, and former Speaker of the House Glenn Richardson for their nomination to the Altamaha Council. The Regional Water Plan provides a recommended path forward to help achieve social, economic, and environmental prosperity for the region. The Council members are grateful for the opportunity to serve the region and State. The Altamaha Council members wish to remain involved in facilitating attainment of the Regional Water Plan benchmarks and making necessary revision to the Plan.

1. INTRODUCTION 



Section 1. Introduction 
Over the last decade, Georgia was one of the fastest growing states in the nation. During this same period the State experienced unprecedented drought. In addition, we have seen increased competition for water supplies, and our perspectives on how we use and value water have also changed. In response to these challenges, a State Water Council was formed to develop a state-wide water planning process. 
In 2008, the State Water Council submitted the 
Georgia Comprehensive State-wide Water Plan 
(State Water Plan) to the Georgia General Assembly and the state-wide water planning process was approved. The purpose of the State Water Plan is to guide Georgia in managing water resources in a sustainable manner to support the State’s economy, protect public health and natural systems, and to enhance the quality of life for all our citizens. The State Water Plan identifies state-wide policies, provides planning guidance, and establishes a planning process for completion of Regional Water Development and Conservation Plans (Regional Water Plans). The Altamaha Regional Water Planning Council (Altamaha Council) was formed to help guide the completion of the Regional Water Plan. The Altamaha Council is composed of membership based on a nomination and appointment process by the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Speaker.  

1.1. The Significance of Water Resources in Georgia  
Of all Georgia’s natural resources, none is more important to the future of our State than water. Georgia has abundant water resources, with 14 major river systems and multiple groundwater aquifer systems. These waters are shared natural resources. Streams and rivers run through many political jurisdictions. The rain that falls in one region of Georgia may replenish the aquifers used by communities many miles away. And, while water in Georgia is abundant, it is not an unlimited resource. It must be carefully managed to meet long-term water needs. 
Since water resources, their conditions, and their uses vary greatly across the State, selection and implementation of management practices on a regional and local level is the most effective way to ensure that current and future needs for water supply and assimilative capacity are met. Therefore, the State Water Plan calls for the preparation of ten regional Water Development and Conservation Plans (Regional Water Plans). The eleventh regional water planning district, the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District (MNGWPD, also known as “the District”), was created by State law in 2001 and had existing plans in place. Figure 1-1 illustrates 
ALTAMAHA 

September 2011 

This Regional Water Plan prepared by the Altamaha Council describes the current and projected water resource needs of the region and summarizes regionally appropriate management strategies (also referred to as water management practices) to be employed in Georgia’s Altamaha Water Planning Region over the next 40 years to help meet these needs. 
1.2. State and Regional Water Planning Process
The State Water Plan calls for the preparation of Regional Water Plans designed to manage water resources in a sustainable manner through 2050. This Regional Water Plan has been prepared following a consensus-based planning process illustrated in Figure 1-2. As detailed in the Altamaha Council’s Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) and Department of Community Affairs (DCA) as well as the Council’s Public Involvement Plan (PIP), the process required and benefited from input of other regional water planning councils, local 
governments, and the public.

1.3. The Altamaha Water Planning Region Vision and Goals 
Following the process established in the State Water Plan, the Altamaha Council was established in February 2009. The Altamaha Council has 29 members, which includes 2 alternates and 2 Ex-Officio Members. Figure 1-3 provides an overview of the Altamaha Region and the residential locations of the Altamaha Council members. 

The Altamaha Council met collectively for the first time on March 13, 2009 at a kickoff meeting for the ten regional water planning councils. The meeting focused on: providing an orientation to the water planning process; a preliminary overview of Georgia’s water resources; and establishing an understanding of the schedule for completing the Regional Water Plan, the Council’s meeting schedule, and requirements. 
Developing the Region’s Council Procedures 
Initially, the planning process focused on establishing the Altamaha Council leadership along with operating procedures and rules for conducting meetings. The operating procedures and rules were appended to the Memorandum of Agreement that was executed between EPD, DCA, and the Altamaha Council. The Memorandum of Agreement was unanimously approved by the Altamaha Council and executed on June 18, 2009. A copy of this document can be accessed on the Internet at: www.altamahacouncil.org/documents/ALT_MOA_Signed-3.pdf. 
In support of the Memorandum of Agreement, the Altamaha Council formed six subcommittees to provide planning guidance during various development stages of the Regional Water Plan. The subcommittees consisted of the following: Vision and Goals, Public Involvement Plan, Water and Wastewater Forecasting, Plan Drafting (Table of Contents), Plan Drafting (Report), and Management Practices. 
Developing Regional Vision and Goals 
A major element of Georgia’s state and regional water planning process is the identification of a Vision and Goals that describe the economic, population, environmental, and water use conditions that are desired for the region. The Vision and Goals describe the Altamaha Council’s priorities for water resource use and

management. This information is used to help guide the identification and selection of water management practices for the Altamaha Region and to communicate these priorities and values to other regions of the State.  
Vision Statement (As established September 17, 2009 and revised on October 28, 2010) 
“The vision of the Altamaha Regional Water Planning Council is to wisely manage, develop, and protect the region’s water resources for current and future generations by ensuring that the Altamaha basin’s water resources are sustainably managed to enhance quality of life and public health, protect natural systems including fishing, wildlife and wildlife utilization activities, and support the basin’s economy.” 
Goals (As established November 19, 2009) 
The Altamaha Council has identified 12 goals for the region. It is important to note that the goals summarized below are not presented in order of priority, but rather were assigned a number to identify specific goals addressed as part of the water management practice selection process (Section 6). 
The Altamaha Council recognizes that we are generally not the primary implementation entity associated with water resource development, use, and management. Nevertheless, the Council wishes to express meaningful, action oriented goals for the future use and management of water resources in our region. The following goals are identified with this principle in mind.

More information regarding the region’s Vision and Goals can be found at: www.altamahacouncil.org/documents/ALT_Vision_Goals_Adopted.pdf. 
The Altamaha Council’s Public Involvement Plan 
A foundational principle of the Georgia water planning process is public and stakeholder participation and coordination among multiple interests. The Altamaha Council developed a Public Involvement Plan to help guide/implement an inclusive planning process. The Public Involvement Plan was adopted by the Altamaha Council on November 19, 2009 and can be accessed at: 
www.altamahacouncil.org/documents/ALT_Public_Involvement_Plan_Adopted.pdf. 
Outreach to the public, local governments, water providers, and users was accomplished by e-mail correspondence, direct communication, and updates provided by Council members at local government and other interest group meetings. Opportunity for public and local government comment was provided at each Council meeting. More information regarding public outreach can be found in the Altamaha Council Public Outreach Technical Memorandum available at: www.altamahacouncil.org/documents/ALT_Vision_Goals_Adopted.pdf.

2. THE ALTAMAHA WATER PLANNING REGION 


Section 2. The Altamaha Water Planning Region 

2.1.  History and Geography 
The Altamaha Region is located within the Coastal Plain Physiographic Province. The topography of the region is characterized by gentle slopes that reflect the geologic history of Tertiary and Quaternary marine incursions and regressions. Approximately 90% of the Coastal Plain sediments exposed in the area are sands and clays. The major land cover in the region is forested lands and agriculture, which are important drivers for the region’s economy. 
Summary  

The Altamaha Region encompasses 16 counties in the south central portion of Georgia. Predominant land cover in the region includes agriculture, forest, and wetland areas. The Altamaha River, formed by the confluence of the Ocmulgee and Oconee Rivers, is the major surface water resource in the region. The Upper Floridan Aquifer, one of the most productive aquifers in the United States, is the primary source of groundwater in the region. The regional domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural, thermoelectric power, and recreational water uses are vital to the region’s economy and quality of life.  


Surface Water Resources 
Figure 2-1 provides an overview of the surface water resources in the Altamaha Region. The Altamaha River is the major surface water feature in the region. The Altamaha River, formed by the confluence of 
the Ocmulgee and Oconee Rivers, is 127 miles long and has a drainage area of approximately 14,000 square miles (EPD, 2003). The river originates in the Northern Piedmont province of north Georgia, traverses southeast through the Coastal Plain region, and discharges to the Atlantic Ocean near Darien, Georgia. It is the only major river in Georgia that is contained wholly within the boundaries of the State. The Altamaha River is a popular fishing resource to the region and is home to 74 species of fish including sunfish, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and catfish. 
ALTAMAHA 

September 2011 

Groundwater Resources 
Groundwater is a very important resource for the Altamaha Region. Figure 2-2 depicts the major aquifers of Georgia. Based on 2010 forecasted groundwater withdrawal data, approximately 94% of groundwater supplied in the region is from the Floridan aquifer, which is one of the most productive groundwater aquifers in the United States. The remaining groundwater is supplied by the surficial, Claiborne, Gordon, Cretaceous, and Dublin aquifers. The Floridan aquifer is primarily comprised of limestone, dolostone, and calcareous sand. The aquifer is generally confined, but at its northern extent there are unconfined and semi-confined zones. The Floridan aquifer increases in thickness eastward across the State and is approximately 400 feet thick in Glynn County. The aquifer is very productive, with typical well yields of 1,000­5,000 gallons per minute. 

The northern portion of the Altamaha Region is within the Cretaceous aquifer area, which consists of sands and gravels. The eastern portion of the Altamaha Region is within the Brunswick aquifer area, which consists of sands and limestones. Where these aquifers exist, they are used in addition to the Floridan aquifer for water supply. A surficial aquifer is present beneath most of the Coastal Plain area; however, it is usually not very thick and is not typically used as a primary source of water supply. 
Climate 
A review of available data for the region from the Southeast Regional Climate Center indicates that the climate is temperate with mild winter and hot summers. Average maximum temperatures are around 92°F in July and average minimum temperatures are around 35°F in January. The area receives abundant rainfall, approximately 42­48 inches per year, with the greatest rainfall occurring during July and August and the least in October and November. Snowfall is rare and typically averages around 
0.2 inches in the northern portion of the region. 
September 2011 

2.2. Characteristics of Region 
The Altamaha Council encompasses 16 counties in the south central portion of Georgia, with a projected 2010 population of approximately 251,000 (Office of Planning and Budget, 2010). The major population centers in the region include Vidalia, Jesup, Swainsboro, Eastman, and Glennville.  
Based on information obtained from Georgia Department of Labor Local Area Profiles, major employers in the region include Rayonier Performance Fibers, LLC in Wayne County and Edwin I. Hatch nuclear power plant in Appling County. The primary economic sectors in the region include agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, professional and business services, education, healthcare, manufacturing, public administration, and construction.  
The region includes four colleges within the Technical College System of Georgia: Altamaha Technical College in Jesup, Southeastern Technical College in Vidalia, Swainsboro Technical College, and Heart of Georgia Technical College in Dublin. The region also includes East Georgia College in Swainsboro, which is part of the University System of Georgia, as well as Middle Georgia College in Eastman, Brewton-Parker College in Mount Vernon, and Troy University in Vidalia. In addition to county jails, there are 15 state and federal correctional facilities, which are important employers and water users in the Altamaha Region. 
A summary of 2005 land cover distribution is shown in Figure 2-3, based on data obtained from the University of Georgia Natural Resources Spatial Analysis. Forests cover 41% of the Altamaha Region, and agriculture and wetlands cover 26% and 15% of the region, respectively. The term wetland refers to land cover and does not infer a regulatory determination. Urban develop­ment accounts for only 6% of the land cover within the Altamaha Region. The remaining land cover (12%) consists of water and open spaces. Based on the inventory developed of Georgia’s irrigated croplands for the year 2008 (UGA Cooperative Extension Irrigation Survey and Dr. Jim Hook), the Altamaha Region is a major producer of cotton and fresh vegetables. These crops cover nearly 45% of the irrigated acreage

within the region. Other crops such as peanuts, corn, and soybeans are also planted widely within the region. 
2.3. Local Policy Context 
Regional Commissions 
Regional Commissions are agencies of local governments and representatives from the private sector that facilitate coordinated and comprehensive planning at the local and regional levels. Regional Commissions often assist their membership with conformity to minimum standards and procedures and serve as liaisons with state and federal agencies. There are 12 Regional Commissions in Georgia. Except for Laurens County, the Heart of Georgia Altamaha Regional Commission covers the same counties as the Altamaha Council. 
In July 2009, the Georgia Department of Community Affairs required the Regional Commissions to adopt, maintain, and implement a Regional Plan (DCA Rule 110-12­6). The Altamaha Regional Commission’s Regional Plan provides guidance to regional and local business leaders, local governments, state and federal agencies, and citizens to promote quality growth in region. It is a vision of the future for the region and includes quality community based objectives related to water resources such as water supply, wastewater, and stormwater management. A key component is the establishment of “performance standards”, which are actions, activities, or programs a local government can implement or participate in that will advance their efforts to meet the vision of the Regional Plan. The Altamaha Regional Commission’s Regional Plan defines two achievement thresholds (Minimum and Excellence), which are attained by implementing the performance standards. Local governments are required to achieve the Minimum Standard to maintain their Qualified Local Government status, which qualifies them for certain state funding. By achieving the Excellence Standard, a local government may be eligible for special incentives. The Heart of Georgia Altamaha Regional Commission is expected to complete the Regional Plan by 2013.

3. WATER RESOURCES OF THE ALTAMAHA WATER REGION 


Section 3. Water Resources of the Altamaha Region 

3.1. Current Major Water Use in Region 
Based on data summarized from the 2009 USGS report “Water Use in Georgia by County for 2005; and Water-Use Trends, 1980-2005”, water supply in the Altamaha Region for 2005 totaled approximately 237 million gallons per day (MGD) and was comprised of 55% groundwater and 45% surface water, as shown in Figure 3-1. A total of 107 MGD was withdrawn from surface waters in the region to supply the energy and agricultural sectors, as shown in Figure 3-2. Figure 3-3 shows that about 130 MGD of groundwater withdrawn was predominantly used to supply industrial (48%) and agricultural uses (33%) while municipal, self­supply, and energy made up the remaining uses. Wastewater treatment types in the region are shown in Figure 3-4. According to the Altamaha Water and Wastewater Forecasting Technical Memorandum (CDM, 2011), 87% of wastewater in the region was disposed of as a municipal/ industrial point source discharge (62%), energy discharge/return flow (20%), or to a land application system (5%). The remaining wastewater was treated by on-site sewage treatment (septic) systems (13%). 
3.2 Resource Assessments 
EPD developed three Resource Assessments to evaluate surface water quality, surface water availability, and groundwater availability throughout the State. These assessments determined the capacity of water resources to meet demands for water supply and wastewater discharge without unreasonable impacts according to metrics established by EPD. These assessments were completed on a resource basis (river basins and aquifers), but are summarized herein as they relate to the Altamaha Region. As described in more detail below, the term “gap” is used to indicate when the current or future use of water has been identified as potentially exceeding the long-term sustainability of the water resource. 

ALTAMAHA 

September 2011 

Full details of each Resource Assessment can be accessed on the EPD website at: 
www.georgiawaterplanning.org/pages/resource_assessments. 

3.2.1. Current Surface Water Quality (Assimilative Capacity) 
The Surface Water Quality (Assimilative Capacity) Resource Assessment (EPD, March 2010) estimates the capacity of Georgia’s surface waters to absorb pollutants without unacceptable degradation of water quality. The term assimilative capacity refers to the ability of a water body to naturally absorb pollutants via chemical and biological processes without exceeding State water quality standards or harming 
September 2011 

3.  Water Resources of the Altamaha Region
 
aquatic life. The current (also referred to as a baseline) assimilative capacity results focus on dissolved oxygen (DO), and nutrients in some areas of the State (specifically nitrogen and phosphorus), and chlorophyll-a (a parameter that is closely tied to lake water quality). The assessments evaluate the impact of current wastewater and stormwater discharges with current (2005) withdrawals, land use, and meteorological conditions. Additional details are provided in the Surface Water Quality Resource Assessment Synopsis (EPD, March 2010).

The results of the current DO modeling are presented in Table 3-1 and Figure 3-6 for the Altamaha Region, which includes portions of the Altamaha, Oconee, Ocmulgee, and Ogeechee river basins. The baseline assimilative capacity represents the model results based on discharge

amounts as reported by wastewater treatment plants in 2007. Segments with exceeded assimilative capacity may result from a number of factors including: point and/or non-point sources of pollutants; modeling assumptions regarding wastewater discharge, stream flow

conditions in the receiving stream. When model

results show DO assimilative capacity as 
exceeded, a potential “gap” exists between the amount of pollutants discharged and the ability of the receiving stream to assimilate the pollutants. These points were considered when developing recommended strategies to address water quality needs in the region.

Nutrient Modeling 
In addition to Assimilative Capacity modeling for DO, EPD completed nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) modeling for the Satilla River watershed. The location of the watershed model boundaries, and lakes, harbors and estuaries model locations are shown in Figure 3-5. It should be noted that only current conditions nutrient modeling was performed. There are currently no nutrient standards for nitrogen and phosphorus, but these standards may be established in forthcoming years. The watershed models show non-point source nutrient loadings of phosphorus and nitrogen to the Brunswick Harbor. The Altamaha Council proactively identified several non-point source best management practices (BMPs) that can be used to help reduce nutrient loading as discussed in Section 6.

3.2.2 Current Surface Water Availability 
The Surface Water Availability Resource Assessment (EPD, March 2010) estimates the availability of surface water to meet current and future municipal, industrial, agricultural, and thermal power water needs as well as the needs of instream and downstream users. Instream uses include fish, wildlife habitat, recreation, and dilution of wastewater, among others. The Surface Water Resource Availability Assessment used specific minimum flow levels as indicators of the ability to support instream uses. Minimum instream flows were based on EPD policy, existing Federal Policy, or existing Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) license requirements. The assessment determines the reliability of the surface water to meet off-stream demands without impacting minimum instream flow requirements. The results of the assessment are provided in terms of both severity (i.e., the amount by which the stream would drop below minimum instream flow requirements) and frequency (i.e., number of days below minimum instream flow requirements). 
As shown in Figure 3-7, there are several surface water planning nodes (shown as yellow circles with red triangles) located in the Altamaha Region. Planning nodes are locations along a river where there is a long-term record of river flow measurements. At each node, the surface water availability models applied the current cumulative upstream consumptive uses of water (i.e., withdrawals minus returns) and authorized reservoir operations to stream flows from 1939 to 2007. From the March 2010 Surface Water Availability Resource Assessment, the term “gap” is used to indicate when the mathematical computer modeling results indicate that forecasted off-stream uses of water increase the severity and/or frequency of critical low flow periods. At these nodes, during certain low flow periods, there is not sufficient water to meet current off-stream demands and also 

meet the targets for support of instream uses. 
Surface water is an important resource used to meet current and future needs in the region, especially for the agricultural sector. Between 2011 and 2050, the use of surface water for agricultural purposes is expected to increase by 9 MGD from 39.9 MGD to 48.9 MGD (Altamaha Water and Wastewater Forecasting Technical Memorandum; CDM, 2011). The only planning node within the region with a surface water gap is the Claxton node (Canoochee River). However, there are surface water gaps outside the region that may be associated with water use within the region. 
ALTAMAHA 

September 2011 

There is a surface water gap at the Atkinson node on the Satilla River and there are surface water uses in three counties (Appling, Jeff Davis, and Wayne) that contribute surface water runoff to the Satilla River. There is also a surface water gap at the Kings Ferry (Ogeechee River) node, which is below the confluence of the Canoochee and Ogeechee Rivers. There is a very small portion of Tattnall County that contributes surface water runoff to the Kings Ferry node. Finally, there is a surface water gap at the Statenville node on the Alapaha River and there is surface water use in a portion of Wilcox County that contributes surface water runoff to the Alapaha River. There are no surface water gaps at the Doctortown (Altamaha River), Lumber City (Ocmulgee River), and Mount Vernon (Oconee River) nodes.  
In the Altamaha Region and surrounding area, critical low flow conditions occur on river systems that do not have any upstream storage reservoirs. In these situations, the Surface Water Availability Resource Assessment uses the unimpaired (meaning estimated flows without off-stream uses) monthly 7 day low flow that occurred over a 10 year period or the daily unimpaired flow (whichever is the lowest value) to determine the critical low flow level/target. It is important to note that when a surface water gap exists, management practices are needed to address times when off­stream uses increase the severity and/or frequency of critical low flow conditions. Low flow conditions have been and will continue to occur; and the Altamaha Council’s management practices are not utilized to address naturally occurring low flow conditions. 
Table 3-2 shows modeled results with information on the size of projected current gaps, with current withdrawals, expressed as changes to natural flow conditions. The values are presented as an average annual flowrate and it is important to note that this summary does not take into account seasonal peaks in consumption and the effects on river flows on a monthly basis. Additional analysis was performed to assess monthly flow conditions. For example, impacts to stream flows are higher in the summer months and lower in the winter months. Additional details are provided in the Altamaha Gap Analysis Technical Memorandum (CDM, 2011).

3.2.3 Current Groundwater Availability 
The Groundwater Availability Resource Assessment (EPD, March 2010) estimates the sustainable yield for prioritized groundwater resources based on existing water use data and aquifer characteristics. EPD prioritized the aquifers based on the 
characteristics of the aquifer, evidence of negative effects, anticipated negative impacts, and other considerations. These assessments identified the sustainable yield, or the volume of groundwater that can be used without negative impacts such as limiting use of neighboring wells (drawdown as a consequence of withdrawal), significantly reducing groundwater contributions to stream baseflows, and the permanent reduction of groundwater levels. If negative impacts occur or are expected to occur, then a groundwater “gap” exists. 
Groundwater from the Upper Floridan Aquifer is a vital resource for the Altamaha Region. In 2005, groundwater was relied upon to meet about 55% of the water use in the region (USGS, 2009). Overall, the results from the March 2010 Groundwater Availability 
Resource Assessment indicate that on a regional basis, for the prioritized aquifers, there is sufficient groundwater supply to meet current demands. However, localized issues may occur if groundwater well densities or withdrawal rates are greater than the scenarios evaluated in the March 2010 Groundwater Availability Resource Assessment.  
As shown in Figure 3-8, 24 counties in southeast Georgia are subject to the Coastal Georgia Water and Wastewater Permitting Plan for Managing Salt Water Intrusion, June 2006 (Coastal Permitting Plan) (www.gadnr.org/cws/). There are seven counties (Appling, Candler, Emanuel, Evans, Tattnall, Toombs, and Wayne Counties) in the Altamaha Region that are located within the “Green Zone”. Per the Coastal Permitting Plan, there are no pumping restrictions from the Upper Floridan

Aquifer in this area; however, there are several water conservation requirements related to groundwater withdrawals.  
3.3. Current Ecosystem Conditions and Instream Uses 
The Altamaha Region encompasses parts of the Southern Coastal Plain and the Southeastern Plains ecoregions. The rivers in these ecoregions support a diversity of fish and wildlife and provide numerous recreational opportunities. There are two Public Fishing Areas (Dodge County and Evans County) and six Wildlife Management Areas managed by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in the Altamaha Region. These areas provide public access to rivers for fishing, hunting, and other recreational activities. Bowens Mill Fish Hatchery, also operated by DNR, produces a variety of fish that are stocked in both public and private waters around the State. 
With over 1.29 million resident anglers, fishing is the most popular wildlife-related activity in Georgia (DNR-WRD, 2006). Annually, the Altamaha River is the destination for a significant number of recreational angling trips and provides a corresponding positive economic impact. The most sought after species are largemouth bass, redbreast sunfish, bluegill, redear sunfish, channel catfish, flathead catfish, and mullet. DNR is currently involved in a restoration effort aimed at striped bass, another popular sport fish. Striped bass numbers in the Altamaha River are thought to be low partially due to the limited number of coolwater springs available in the river during summer. 
The Altamaha River and its tributaries provide important riverine habitat for diadromous fish (fish that travel between rivers and the ocean to breed), including American eel, American shad, hickory shad, blueback herring, Atlantic sturgeon, and shortnose sturgeon. The Altamaha River also supports commercial fishing for American shad, eels, blue crab, and shrimp.  
The 2005 Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy identified 71 high priority animals that inhabit the Southern Coastal Plain ecoregion and 85 high priority animals in the Southeastern Plains ecoregion (more information is available at (www.georgiawildlife.com/node/1370). Several of these species depend on rivers for part or all of their lifecycle including amphibians, fish, mammals, mollusks, and reptiles. Federally endangered species in the Altamaha Region that inhabit rivers and lakes include the shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum). There were 25 identified high priority habitats in the Southern Coastal Plain ecoregion and 27 high priority habitats in the Southeastern Plains (CWCS, 2005) (for more information on high priority waters and protected species go to www.georgiawildlife.com/node/1377 and www.georgiawildlife.com/node/1366). The Nongame Conservation Section (Department of Natural Resources, Wildlife Resources Division) can be contacted for additional information on rare aquatic species. Riverine systems and processes are important to many of these habitats such as alluvial rivers and swamps, bottomland hardwood forests, blackwater streams, canebreaks, and open-water ponds and lakes. These high priority streams and watersheds are considered important for 
3-10 September 2011 

conservation of at least one high-priority habitat or species located in the Altamaha Region. 
Several rivers and watersheds in this region have been identified as ecologically important, including the Altamaha, Ocmulgee, and Ogeechee rivers. In the Southern Coastal Plain ecoregion, conservation lands make up 14% of the land area (CWCS, 2005). The percentage of lands in conservation is lower in the Southeastern Plains ecoregion at 2.6% (CWCS, 2005).  
The major rivers that flow through and from the Altamaha Region also pass through the Coastal Regional Council boundary and discharge to the Atlantic Ocean. The coastal area contains a unique combination of fresh, brackish and salt water environments. The area is defined by barrier islands, sand beaches, open Atlantic Ocean, and there are 9 major estuaries including 350,000 acres of salt marsh and 150,000 acres of open water. Shipping channels are maintained in three estuaries – the lower Savannah River, St. Simons, and Cumberland. Otherwise, the remainder is very similar in depth, size and other physical characteristics as they were at the time of European settlements of Georgia. 
An estuary is a semi-enclosed body of water, which has a free connection with the sea and within which sea water is measurably diluted with fresh water. Without the fresh water input, such areas in Georgia would be salt water lagoons or bays. A key characteristic of an estuary is salinity, which can be highly variable depending on the location within the estuary and the estuaries itself. Sources of freshwater for estuary include: fresh water river discharges, industrial and municipal discharges of groundwater after use and treatment, and upwelling of groundwater through geologic features. Estuarine environments support a diversity of life, both aquatic and terrestrial, unparalleled in other portions of the State. Hundreds of species of animals and plants exist because of the unique mixing of salt water and fresh water. If the fresh water were removed, the diversity would change immensely from what is found today. Maintaining freshwater inputs to Georgia’s estuaries is vital for maintaining a unique coastal environment, which provides a myriad of social and economic benefits, as well as invaluable ecological services to the citizens of Georgia.

Impaired Water Bodies 
Under Section 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA), a total maximum daily load (TMDL) must be developed for waters that do not meet their designated uses. A TMDL represents the maximum pollutant loading that a water body can assimilate and continue meeting its designated use (i.e., not exceeding State water quality standards). A water body is deemed to be impaired if it does not meet the applicable criteria for a particular pollutant; consequently, TMDLs are required to be established for these waters to reduce the concentrations of the exceeding parameters in order to comply with State water quality standards. For the Altamaha Region, there are 75

4. FORECASTING FUTURE WATER RESOURCE NEEDS 


Section 4. Forecasting Future Water Resource Needs 

Water and wastewater demand forecasts, along with the Resource Assessments (Section 3), form the foundation for water planning in the Altamaha Region and serve as the basis for the selection of water management practices (Sections 6 and 7). The tables and graphics in this section present the regional water and wastewater forecasts for 10-year intervals from 2010 through 2050 for four water use sectors: municipal, industrial, agriculture, and thermoelectric generation. 
The methodology to forecast water and wastewater demands is based primarily on the assumption that there will be a continuation of existing trends and practices. It does not make a determination regarding the efficiency or inefficiency of forecasted demands, only that they are expected to occur given current trends. Initial forecasting does not take into account management practices, including water conservation (other than passive conservation as described in more detail below) that may be adopted by Regional Water Planning Councils to reduce the expected magnitude of demand (see Sections 6-8 for additional details on water conservation and other management practices). Additionally, this forecasting effort does not change EPD requirements related to individual permitting decisions, but represents a forecast for regional water planning that will help guide permitting and funding decisions. 

During development of the Regional Water Plan, there was a concerted effort to strike a balance between broad coverage and local data by using consistent data collection on a regional basis modified as appropriate with local provider input. These data and resulting forecasts are not applicable between regions or between providers within the region. 
4.1. Municipal Forecasts 
Municipal water includes water supplied to residences, commercial businesses, and small industries (water use by higher water using industries are forecasted separately and those major industrial sectors are identified in Section 4.2). Residential water uses include water for normal household purposes: cooking, bathing, and clothes washing, among others. Commercial water uses include water used by hotels, restaurants, retail stores, and office buildings, among others. Municipal water demands may be served by public water systems, private water systems, or self-supplied by the user (such as individual wells).

Population Projections 
Municipal water and wastewater forecasts are closely tied to population projections for the counties within the Altamaha Region. The population projections were developed by the Georgia Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget, which is charged in State law (O.C.G.A. 45-12-171) with the responsibility for preparing, maintaining, and furnishing official demographic data for the State. The population projection results by county for the planning period are shown in Table 4-1.

Municipal Water Forecasts 
The municipal water forecasts were calculated by multiplying the baseline per capita water use by the population served. Per capita water use rates are different for public water systems in comparison to self-supplied water use; therefore, the demands are calculated separately and then summed together. The publicly-supplied water use rate was determined for each county within the region. The self-supply per capita demand is estimated at 75 gallons per capita per day (gpcd). 
The forecasted water use rates for the Altamaha Region were adjusted based on two plumbing code changes which mandate new water saving lavatory fixtures. The 
September 2011 

4. Forecasting Future WaterResources Needs 
National Energy Policy Act of 1992 reduced the maximum toilet flush volume from 
3.5 to 1.6 gallons per flush (gpf) for all toilets available in the U.S. starting in 1994. The Georgia Water Stewardship Act of 2010 reduces the maximum flush volume to 
1.28 gpf for all new toilets installed in Georgia after July 1, 2012. As new homes are constructed and less efficient toilets are replaced within existing housing stock, the water use rate is reduced over time. Additional information on plumbing code efficiency adjustments and rationale for per capita water use is available in the Altamaha Water and Wastewater Forecasting Technical Memorandum (CDM, 2011). Table 4-2 summarizes the estimated water savings for both acts. On a regional basis, municipal water demands are expected to be about 11% lower as a result of water demand reduction (4 MGD in 2050) that can be attributed to passive conservation.

Total regional municipal water demands are shown in Figure 4-1 for the Altamaha Region. In addition, this figure shows the distribution in demands resulting from public water systems and self-supply systems. In the Altamaha Region, all municipal water demands are satisfied by utilizing groundwater as the sole source for withdrawals.

4. Forecasting Future WaterResources Needs 
Municipal Wastewater Forecasts 
Municipal wastewater forecasts are based on estimates of indoor municipal (public and self supplied) water use. Indoor water use may be treated by centralized treatment plants or onsite sanitary sewage (septic) systems. Centralized treatment plants may discharge to a water body or to a land application system (LAS).  
Estimates of wastewater generated from publicly-supplied and self-supplied water use (from the passive conservation scenario above) were calculated and then assigned to septic and centralized wastewater flows. U.S. Census data on the percent of households with septic systems were obtained by county. For planning purposes, it was estimated that all of the wastewater generated from self-supplied water use is disposed of via septic system. Dividing the number of municipally supplied households on septic by the U.S. Census estimate of the number of households by county provided an estimate of the percent of municipally supplied households that discharged to septic systems in 2005. 
Estimates of flows treated at centralized wastewater treatment plants are derived from the portion of wastewater flow that is not septic. In addition, a percent of flow is added to account for infiltration and inflow (I/I) that occurs in the wastewater collection system before reaching the treatment facility. I/I is a term used to describe groundwater and stormwater that enters into the dedicated wastewater system. An initial I/I estimate of 20% was used to calculate return flows. This estimate was adjusted when there was county-specific data to support an alternate value.  
Finally, wastewater effluent flow from centralized treatment facilities is either discharged as a point source to a receiving water body or delivered to a land application system. EPD permit data as well as feedback from municipal suppliers were used to determine the ratio of point discharge to land application system for each county. Municipal wastewater forecasts are shown in Figure 4-2.

4. Forecasting Future WaterResources Needs 
4.2. Industrial Forecasts 
Industrial forecasts show the future need from the major water using industries including: food, textile, and paper. Industries require water for processes, sanitation, cooling, and other purposes, in addition to domestic (employee) water use. Some industries, such as poultry processors, operate under strict U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines that require water use to maintain sanitary conditions within the facilities. Water need (i.e., the total water requirements of an industry, or the water withdrawals) is based on either production or employment, depending on the available information. 
Employment Projections 
The employment projections provided information on the anticipated employment growth rate for each industrial sector. The University of Georgia produced the industry-specific rates of growth for employment for EPD, which were then used to calculate the future water needs for specific industries within the Altamaha Region. General employment in heavy water-using industries such as textile and paper sectors shows an upward trend throughout the 40 year planning period, while employment projections in the food manufacturing sector are maintained relatively constant. 
Industrial Water Forecasts 
Industrial water forecasts were calculated using information and data specific to each of the major water using industries. For industries where information was available on water use per unit of production, water forecasts were based on production. For industries where product based forecasts were not possible, industry-specific workforce projections were assumed to reflect the anticipated growth in water use within the industry. Figure 4-3 shows the industrial water and wastewater forecast over the planning period. Similar to the municipal water demands, industrial demands in the Altamaha Region are fully satisfied by utilizing groundwater as the sole source for withdrawals. 
Industrial Wastewater Forecasts 
Industrial wastewater forecasts were calculated for each sector by multiplying the industrial water use by the ratio of wastewater to water for that industrial sector. For example in the apparel category, for every gallon of water used, there will be 0.6 gallons of wastewater produced. For the paper category, for every gallon of water used, there will be 1.0 gallon of wastewater produced. 
Once the industrial wastewater flows were estimated, flows were separated between point discharges and land application. The industrial wastewater forecasts are presented in Figure 4-3 by the anticipated disposal system type: industrial wastewater treatment (point discharge), LAS, or discharge for municipal wastewater treatment.

4.3. Agricultural Forecasts 
The agricultural water use forecasts include irrigation demands for both crop and non-crop uses (i.e., livestock, nurseries, and golf courses). The crop forecasts, developed by the University of Georgia for 2011 through 2050, provide a range of irrigation water use from dry to wet climate conditions based on the acres irrigated for each crop. Table 4-3 lists a drier-than-normal year crop irrigation forecast for each county. 
The University of Georgia also compiled non-crop (including non-permitted) agricultural water demand with the assistance of industry associations. Similar to crop irrigation, forecasts for nursery and greenhouse water use were also developed for a range of climate conditions over the planning period. For planning purposes, the drier-than-normal nursery/greenhouse forecasts are presented in Table 4-3. For golf courses and livestock production, current (2011) water forecasts were developed, but future forecasts were not developed for this first round of regional water planning due to lack of available data. Current water demands were held constant throughout the planning period for these water use sectors. Full documentation of the methodology and results of the agricultural forecasts developed by the University of Georgia are available at: 
www.nespal.org/sirp/waterinfo/State/awd/agwaterdemand.htm. 
Figure 4-4 shows the regional agricultural demands by source of supply. An 18% increase in agricultural water demand is projected by 2050 for the Altamaha Region. The largest increase in forecasted demand occurs in Toombs County, with a 36% increase by 2050. Tattnall and Evans Counties have the next largest forecasted demand increases at 26% and 22%, respectively. All other counties in the region are 
September 2011 

forecasted to have increases of less than 20% through 2050, with Montgomery and Johnson Counties having the smallest increases at 8% and 2%, respectively. As shown in Figure 4-4, the majority of the agricultural withdrawals (over 60%) are supplied by groundwater and the remainder by surface water.

4.4. Water for Thermoelectric Power Forecasts 
Thermoelectric water withdrawal and consumption demands were developed for the State of Georgia based on forecasted power generation needs and assumptions regarding future energy generation processes. Full details of the state-wide energy sector water demand forecast can be accessed on the EPD website at: 
www.georgiawaterplanning.org/pages/forecasting/energy_water_use.php. 
Thermoelectric water demands for the Altamaha Region are shown in Table 4-4. The first two rows show the regional forecast of water demand for existing facilities and facilities planned to become operational by 2020. Beyond 2020, the location of generating facilities that may be built is not known. Therefore, water demands beyond 2020 associated with this unplanned power capacity need were developed on a state-wide basis and not disaggregated regionally. The state-wide forecasts show that in 2030, an additional 58 MGD of water consumption (106 MGD of withdrawal) is needed to meet projected state-wide energy production requirements, with 170 MGD of consumption (313 MGD of withdrawal) needed state-wide in 2050. 
The Altamaha Council acknowledges that some portion of the future additional generating capacity may be constructed in the Altamaha Region in future years. Council discussed “economy of scale” considerations for siting, designing, and constructing new generating capacity and identified that about a 2,000 megawatt facility would be the likely capacity to warrant new capital investment. For the purposes of water planning, the Altamaha Council developed the water demand scenario shown in Table 4-4 for 2030-2050, with the acknowledgement that actual

demand may vary considerably. This approach results in 28% of the unassigned state-wide consumptive use being projected to occur in the Altamaha Region in 2030 and 20% in 2050. The Altamaha Council also identified several principles to consider when developing additional energy needs including: locating facilities in areas of sufficient supply, encouraging reuse where possible and feasible, and encouraging close cooperation with local government to promote “fairness” in water supply and accommodating other possible growth sectors.

5. COMPARISON OF AVAILABLE RESOURCE CAPACITY AND FUTURE NEEDS 


Section 5. Comparison of Available Resource Capacity and Future Needs 
This Section compares the water and wastewater demand forecasts (Section 4), along with the Resource Assessments (Section 3), providing the basis for selecting water management practices (Sections 6 and 7). Areas where future demands exceed the capacity of the resource have a gap that will be addressed through water management practices. This Section summarizes the gaps and water supply needs for the Altamaha Region. 
5.1. Groundwater Availability Comparisons 
Groundwater from the Upper Floridan Aquifer is a vital resource for the Altamaha Region. Overall, the results from the Groundwater Availability Resource Assessment (EPD, March 2010) indicate that the sustainable yield for the modeled portions of the regional aquifer(s) is greater than the forecasted demands.  
At this time, no regional groundwater resource gaps are expected to occur in the Altamaha Region over the 40 year planning horizon. However, localized gaps could occur if well densities and/or withdrawal rates result in exceedance of sustainable yield metrics. In addition, some counties including Candler, Emanuel, Evans, Jeff Davis, Montgomery, Wayne, Wheeler, and Wilcox Counties may need additional permitted capacity if future demand for groundwater exceeds permitted groundwater withdrawal limits. The comparison 

of existing groundwater permitted capacity to forecasted future demand in the Altamaha Region is shown in Table 5-1. Please note that sufficient capacity at the county level does not preclude localized municipal permit capacity shortages. Local water providers in counties with large demand forecasts should review their permitting needs.

5.2. Surface Water Availability Comparisons 
Surface water is an important resource used to meet current and future needs of the Altamaha Region, especially in the agricultural and energy sectors. There are several surface water planning nodes located in and in close proximity to the Altamaha Region. From the Surface Water Availability Resource Assessment (EPD, March 2010), the basic conclusions of the future conditions modeling show surface water gaps (i.e., there are times when there is insufficient water to meet off-stream demands and also meet the targets for support of instream uses) at the following nodes: Claxton (Canoochee River), Kings Ferry (Ogeechee River, outside of Altamaha Region), Atkinson (Satilla River, outside of Altamaha Region) and Statenville (Alapaha River outside of the Altamaha Region). When assessing this issue, the Altamaha Council recognized that surface water gaps are driven by both net consumption (withdrawal minus returns) and year to year variations in river flows. In wet years, the region is likely to not experience any shortfalls to off-stream uses and instream needs. In dry years, the shortfalls are likely to be more severe. In order to better assess these shortfalls and to better understand the types of management practices that may be required, a more detailed quantification of the frequency and severity of shortage was completed. 
First, a quantification of the largest flow shortfall was completed. This quantification estimated the average flow of water that would be needed to increase stream flows to their minimum target levels, and it quantified the number of days that the flow would be needed. The flow needed and the number of days that it is needed results in an estimate of the total volume of water that would be needed to address the largest flow shortfall. 
September 2011 

Using the same approach outlined above, quantification of shortfalls was completed for the average flow needed to address 90% of the shortages and 50% of the shortages. It is important to note that in some cases, the largest flow shortage did not always correspond to the largest volume shortage because some shortfalls are lower in flow rate but longer in duration. 
The quantification of shortfalls is especially relevant when selecting water management practices. For example, if the preferred management practice is to replace surface water diversions with groundwater withdrawals, it is important to know how much flow needs to be generated and for what length of time. This process will in turn dictate the number and size of wells needed to generate the flow. If a reservoir is the preferred practice, then one needs to know the largest volume of storage needed because stream flow needs can then be addressed by controlling the rate of flow released from the reservoir. In addition, since the largest shortages occur less frequently, there are important cost-benefit considerations associated with addressing the largest and more infrequent shortfalls. 
The geographic location of the modeled regional surface water gaps are shown in Figure 5-1. The gaps are quantified in terms of flow. The flow values depicted in the charts represent the average additional flow at that node that would be needed to close the specified gap occurrence. These flows are presented on a percent capture basis. The term “capture” refers to the percent of all gap occurrences at a node that are less than or equal to this flow value. For example, the 50% capture value indicates the flow that would be needed to close half the gap occurrences at a particular node, and the 100% capture value indicates the flow that would be needed to close all gap occurrences at a particular node. In addition to flow, values are given for gap duration (number of days the flow is below 7Q10) and volume (total volumetric shortfall to 7Q10 expressed in acre-feet) at each node. The years and months listed in the figure are tied to the hydrologic data set used in the modeling. The specific years and months are the periods of time when the referenced gap occurred. For example, at the Claxton node the largest flow gap (100% capture) occurred between June and August 1952. 
The projected increased use of surface water for the counties within the Altamaha Region that have current and future gaps are shown in Table 5-2. Since there are current gaps at the referenced planning nodes, development of additional surface water to meet projected needs will need to done in a manner that does not increase current gaps.

5.3. Surface Water Quality Comparisons (Assimilative Capacity) 
This Section summarizes the results of Resource Assessment modeling when all municipal and industrial wastewater treatment facilities operate at permit conditions, and provides a comparison of existing wastewater permitted capacity to the projected 2050 wastewater forecast flows. A discussion on non-point source pollution is also included. 
Future Treatment Capacity Needs 
Existing municipal wastewater permitted capacities were compared to projected 2050 wastewater flows to estimate future treatment capacity needs by county. This analysis was done for both point sources and land application systems, both of which are permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). As shown in Table 5-3, Candler and Evans Counties may have small infrastructure needs by 2050. It should be noted that the comparison in Table 5-3 was completed at the county level and localized shortages in treatment capacity may exist. 
Assimilative Capacity Assessments 
The Assimilative Capacity Assessment at permit conditions (EPD, March 2011) was developed to estimate the ability of streams, estuaries, and harbors to assimilate pollutants under future conditions. The modeling was focused on dissolved oxygen (DO) and based upon municipal and industrial wastewater facilities operating at their full permitted levels in terms of flow and effluent discharge limits. The results of the DO modeling are presented in Table 5-4 and Figure 5-2 for the Altamaha Region, which includes portions of the Altamaha, Oconee, Ocmulgee, and Ogeechee River basins. 
Figure 5-3 illustrates the number of reaches within each river basin in the region that have exceeded their DO assimilative capacity in either the baseline or permitted model runs or both. It is important to note that exceedance of assimilative capacity on a reach could be the result of a point source discharge, non-point source loading, or a naturally low DO condition. The river basin tables in the figure summarize recommendations that arose out of coordination with EPD’s Watershed Protection Branch and the number of reaches within the basin for which these recommendations apply. In addition to improving low DO conditions in surface waters, these recommendations are aimed at providing sufficient future wastewater permit capacity and preparing for future nutrient standards in receiving waters.

Non-Point Source Pollution 
Non-point source pollution accounts for the majority of surface water impairments in the region according to the 2008 303(d) list of Rivers, Streams, Lakes, and Reservoirs published by EPD. Non-point source pollution can occur as a result of human activities, including urban development, agriculture, and silviculture, and as a result of non-human influences such as wildlife and naturally-occurring nutrients. An important component of any non-point source management program is identifying those pollutant sources that are resulting from human activities. 
Watershed nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) modeling was conducted for the Brunswick Harbor/Satilla River watersheds. The goal was to identify nutrient loading rates from different portions of the watershed under various hydrologic conditions and evaluate them in relation to corresponding land uses and potential non-point source contributions. Results of watershed nutrient modeling identify portions of the watershed where there are higher concentration of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in stormwater runoff than other parts of the watershed. 
There are currently no nutrient standards in place for the Altamaha Region, so there is no absolute threshold against which these nutrient loadings are compared. Rather, the nutrient model results are beneficial for relative comparisons to target areas where implementation of non-point source control management practices will have the greatest benefit. Nutrient and non-point source control management practices specific to land uses within the Altamaha Region are discussed in Section 6.

6. ADDRESSING WATER NEEDS AND REGIONAL GOALS 


Section 6. Addressing Water Needs and Regional Goals 
This Section presents the Altamaha Council’s water management practices selected to address resource shortfalls or gaps identified and described in Section 5, and/or to meet the Council’s Vision and Goals described in Section 1. 
6.1. Identifying Water Management Practices 
The comparison of Resource Assessments and forecasted demands presented in Section 5 identifies the Region’s likely resource shortfalls or gaps and demonstrates the necessity for region and resource specific water management practices. In cases where shortfalls or gaps appear to be unlikely, the Council identified needs (e.g., facility/infrastructure needs and practices, programmatic practices, etc.) and corresponding management practices that are aligned with the Region’s Vision and Goals. In selecting the actions needed (i.e., water management practices), the Council considered practices identified in existing plans, the Region’s Vision and Goals, and coordinated with local governments and water providers as well as neighboring Councils that share these water resources. 
Review of Existing Plans and Practices 
The Council conducted a comprehensive review of existing local and regional water management plans 

and relevant related documents to frame the selection of management practices. The types of plans/studies that were reviewed to support identification and selection of management practices for the Altamaha Region consisted of the following: 
. 	Comprehensive Work Plans (local and regional scale) 
. 	EPD databases (permitted withdrawals, planned projects, and proposed reservoirs) 
. 	State-wide guidance documents (conservation, cost, and water planning) 
. 	Best Management Practices (agriculture, forestry, and stormwater 
management) 

ALTAMAHA 

September 2011 

. Water quality studies (basin, watershed, and local scale) 
. TMDL evaluations 
When possible, successful management practices already planned for and/or in use in the Altamaha Region formed the basis for the water management practices selected by the Council. 
6.2. Selected Water Management Practices for the Altamaha Region 
Table 6-1 summarizes the Altamaha Council’s selected management practices by source of supply for the relevant demand sector(s), including surface water supply for agricultural irrigation, permitted municipal and industrial water and wastewater capacity, water quality assimilative capacity (dissolved oxygen) challenges, current water quality impairments, and nutrient considerations for the Satilla River watershed. The table summarizes general information regarding management practices needed to meet forecasted needs, and more detailed information on management practices needed to address gaps between available resources and forecasted needs. Information on shared resources is provided at the end of the table to identify where management practices in other regional Councils are also needed to address identified gaps. The Altamaha Council reviewed a number of existing local and regional water management plans and related documents during the development and selection of management practices. A detailed list of plans and documents that were considered can be found in the Altamaha Plans Reviewed in Selecting Management Practices Technical Memorandum (CDM, 2011).  
The most significant gaps in the Altamaha Region are surface water availability gaps driven by agricultural irrigation usage. As such, the majority of water supply management practices in Table 6-1 are intended to address agricultural surface water use (in the table the term 7Q10 refers to the 1 in 10 year 7 day low flow condition). Figure 5-1 shows the location and magnitude of regional surface water gaps and should be referenced to provide the geographic focus of the management practices. The Altamaha Council considered a number of practices to close these surface water availability gaps, ranging from agricultural conservation to one or more regional reservoirs. While reservoirs would provide multiple potential benefits, the flat topography of the region makes siting of regional reservoirs difficult, expensive, and may have associated impacts. The Altamaha Council concluded that integrating practices, rather than using a single practice would be more effective at addressing gaps and more economically feasible. Figure 6-1 illustrates the Altamaha Council’s recommended suite of surface water availability management practices, which will be implemented via an incremental and adaptive approach. Those practices that are less costly and more readily implemented are prioritized for short-term implementation. If resource needs are not met and/or gaps are not addressed, then more costly and complex management practices will be pursued. 
September 2011 

Surface water gaps (increased frequency or severity of 7Q10 low flow conditions) in the region exist under current and future conditions at the Claxton planning node and will be addressed by management practices that reduce net consumption, replace surface water use with groundwater use, and improve data on frequency and magnitude of gaps among others. The gap at Claxton occurs primarily as a result of net consumption associated with agricultural water use in the February-November timeframe. The Altamaha Council’s management practices will address a significant portion of the net consumption at Claxton and when combined with management practices from the Coastal Georgia and Savannah-Upper Ogeechee water planning regions will close surface water gaps over time. Finally, as described in Section 5.2 it is important to keep in mind that shortage to low flow conditions do not occur every year. In some cases, for years with shortages the shortages do not occur for the entire year. 
Figure 6-2 illustrates the Altamaha Council’s recommended suite of surface water quality management practices in a phased approach. Table 6-1 also includes the Altamaha Council’s recommended management practices to address water quality gaps, including stream segments with no dissolved oxygen assimilative capacity and insufficient wastewater permit capacity.  
In addition to addressing gaps, the Altamaha Council identified several management practice recommendations in Table 6-1 to address forecasted future uses. These recommendations include such practices as the additional sustainable development of groundwater and surface water in areas with sufficient supply; management of other water quality issues such as non-point source runoff, nutrient loadings, TMDLs in the region; and additional educational and ordinance practices. The selected management practices will over time address identified gaps and meet future uses when combined with practices for all shared resource regions.

Summary of Management Practices for Shared Resources – The Altamaha Region will combine its management practices with the following Councils to address shared resource gaps.  
Surface Water Quantity – Canoochee River (Claxton), Ogeechee River (Kings Ferry), Satilla River (Atkinson), and Alapaha River (Statenville) Altamaha – The Altamaha Regional Council has identified the management practices in the above table to address the majority of the gap at Claxton, a portion of the cumulative gap at Kings Ferry, a small portion of the cumulative gap at Statenville, and a portion of the cumulative gap at Atkinson. Coastal Georgia – The Coastal Georgia Regional Council has identified water conservation, replacement of surface water use with groundwater, refinement of forecasting and modeling data, and potential use of incentives and new permit conditions to address a small portion of the cumulative gap at Kings Ferry. The management practices that close gaps at Kings Ferry will also close the gaps at Claxton and Eden.  


6. Addressing Water Needs and Regional Goals 
Savannah-Upper Ogeechee – The Savannah-Upper Ogeechee Regional Council has identified water conservation, replacement of surface water use with groundwater use, and agricultural water use monitoring program to address a portion of the cumulative gap at Kings Ferry. 
Upper Oconee – The Upper Oconee Regional Council has identified the use of variable rate irrigation, development of new groundwater wells, and encouraging centralized sewer in developing areas to address a small portion of the gap at Eden and a small portion of the cumulative gap at Kings Ferry. 
Suwannee-Satilla– The Suwannee-Satilla Regional Council has identified water conservation, replacement of surface water use with groundwater use, refinement of forecasting and modeling data, and potential use of incentives and new permit conditions to address the majority of the cumulative gap at Statenville and at Atkinson. 
Upper Flint – The Upper Flint Regional Council has identified conservation, investigation of replacement of surface water with groundwater, greater utilization of farm ponds, and consideration of new storage and Aquifer Storage and Recovery to address a portion of the cumulative gap at Statenville. 
Surface Water Quality: 
Satilla River Watershed Model – The Suwannee-Satilla Regional Council has identified the same Best Management Practices for reducing nutrient loading as are summarized in the above table for the Altamaha Council. 
Suwannee-Satilla – One reach with exceeded dissolved oxygen assimilative capacity in the Suwannee River basin is shared with the Suwannee-Satilla Region. Both regions recommend improved level of wastewater treatment to improve instream dissolved oxygen, implementation of ammonia limits, and improved treatment for nutrients (Nitrogen and Phosphorus). 
Notes: 
1Seek to reduce frequency and severity of human impacts to 7Q10 low flow conditions in the region, which are 
associated with agricultural water use in portions of the Altamaha Region. Focus on surface water permit holders 
and new surface water permit requests in Canoochee Watershed [Candler, Evans, Emanuel, Tattnall, and 
Bulloch Counties (Claxton Gap)], Ogeechee Watershed [Candler, Emmanuel, and Evans Counties (Eden and 

Kings Ferry Gap)], Alapaha Watershed [Wilcox County (Statenville Gap)], and Satilla Watershed [Appling, Jeff 
Davis, and Wayne Counties (Atkinson Gap)].

7. IMPLEMENTING WATER 
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 



Section 7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
This section presents the Altamaha Council’s estimated timeframes for the implementation of the water management practices identified in Section 6. Schedules for implementation, in addition to the early step(s) required to initiate implementation of a given practice, are presented for both short- and long-term actions. The Altamaha Council has defined short-term as years 2010 to 2020 and long-term as 2020 to 2050. As the State Water Plan provides, this Plan will be primarily implemented by the various water users in the region, therefore, the Altamaha Council has described the roles and responsibilities of the implementing parties as well as the fiscal implications of the practices. 
The Altamaha Council also emphasizes that the implementation of recommended management practices are predicated on a number of planning assumptions and/or may be impacted by unanticipated or currently unknown factors including: projected growth of population, industry, agricultural and energy needs; shared resources with surrounding regions; future identification/proposal of a significant upstream water resource project; data sets and assumptions related to water use, water withdrawals and returns; data regarding water quality and watershed models; rules and regulations regarding water resource use and management; and Resource Assessment tools for 

surface water availability, surface water quality and groundwater availability. Consequently, significant changes or departures from these planning assumptions, forecasts, and Resource Assessment tools may require a modification of the recommended management practices, the implementation schedule, and/or the implementing entities/affected stakeholders. Future planning efforts should confirm current assumptions and make necessary revisions and/or improvements to the conclusions reached during this round of planning.  
7.1. Implementation Schedule and Roles of Responsible Parties 
Table 7-1 ties the resource shortfalls and the needs specified by the Council and the corresponding management practices detailed in Table 6-1 to the parties who will implement those practices. This table also describes the timeframe for implementation and the specific steps required for implementation.

7.2. Fiscal Implications of Selected Water Management Practices 
The following subsections discuss planning level cost estimates for the water management practices selected by the Altamaha Council and potential funding sources and options. Successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan is highly dependent on the ability of state and local governments, water providers, and utilities to fund the needed implementation actions. 
Planning Level Cost Estimates 
Planning level cost estimates were prepared for each management practice as shown in Table 7-2 using planning guidance documents, the knowledge base of previous state and utility planning efforts, availability of quantifiable data, and other sources of information, as listed below: 
. 	Georgia Environmental Protection Division Supplemental Guidance for Planning Contractors: Water Management Practice Cost Comparison dated March 2010 (Revised March 2011). 
. 	Water Conservation Analysis Technical Memorandum to Supplement Council’s Plan prepared by CDM for Georgia EPD draft dated July 2011.  
. 	CDM Water Supply Cost Estimation Study prepared for the South Florida Water Management District dated February 2007. 
. 	EPA Report titled Costs of Urban Stormwater Control Practices – Preliminary Report dated February 5, 2006. 
. 	EPA Report titled Costs of Urban Stormwater Control dated January 2002. 
. 	St. Johns River Water Management District Report titled Water Supply Needs and Sources Assessment Alternative Water Supply Strategies Investigation, Water Supply and Wastewater Systems Component Cost Information dated 1997 (Publication Number SJ97-SP3). 
. 	Preliminary estimates of production well yields and costs from local licensed well drillers in Georgia (Bishop Well and Pump Service and Grosch Irrigation Company.) 
. 	Irrigation Conservation Practices Appropriate for the Southeastern United States. Project Report 32. Prepared in cooperation with the Georgia DNR, EPD under Proposal No. ES61135FC1. 
. 	Groundwater Flow Modeling of the Coastal Plain Aquifer System of Georgia. Draft Report completed for EPD as part of State of Georgia Groundwater Resource Assessment (December 2009).  
7-16 	September 2011 

. 	FY 2004 Sussex Conservation District Cover Crop Program Fact Sheet. Sussex Conservation District, Georgetown, Delaware. Dated 2003. 
. 	North Carolina State University Department of Forestry Costs of Forestry Best Management Practices in the South: A Review. 
. 	Recent bid tabulations for wastewater treatment facilities. 
The cost estimates are unit cost estimates where there is a lack of detail or specificity about the management practice. For example, for an inter-basin transfer of water, the cost is driven by the length and size of the pipeline and the quantity to be transferred. If the connection locations and or the transfer quantity are not known, a unit cost per mile of pipeline is given. Where there is detail about the management practice, unit cost data were used to develop an approximate capital/programmatic cost. The capital costs were adjusted to 2010 dollars using the Engineering News Record Cost Index. In summary, some cost estimates are unit costs with different unit basis and some costs are approximate capital costs. Therefore, each management practice is assigned a cost (where applicable) rather than rolling up the costs into general categories since they may not be additive. The cost information provided in this document will be used to pursue loans, grants, and other funding options that can be prioritized throughout the region.  
Funding Sources and Options 
Several different funding sources and options will be used to secure funding for the different management practices outlined in this Plan including: 
. 	The State Revolving Fund Program 
. 	Other State of Georgia Funding Programs 
. 	State and Federal Grants 
. 	Water/Wastewater System Revenues 
. 	State and local government incentive programs 
More details on potential loan and grant programs are provided for the management practices in Table 7-2. Below is a list of some of the larger organizations and agencies that provide funding for the types of management practices recommended in this Plan. It is important to note that funding sources and opportunities change on a yearly basis.

7.3. Alignment with Other Plans 
The Altamaha Council’s Plan and management practices selection process was based on identifying and supporting existing policy, planning, and projects. Local comprehensive plans, planned and/or permitted projects were relied upon in developing the Regional Water Plan. This approach is tailored to maintain consistency with, and to maximize support for, locally driven water resource management decisions. The Altamaha Council did identify potential challenges associated with both the cost and technical issues that the region may face; especially regarding water and wastewater needs for both new and aging infrastructure. In addition, addressing existing surface water gaps must be accomplished in a manner that does not cause adverse impacts to local water users and local governments. 
ALTAMAHA 

September 2011 7-27 

The challenges of funding Plan recommendations and addressing future technical and regulatory issues is especially difficult for smaller towns and utilities, agricultural water uses, and small businesses that rely on natural resources. The successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan will be dependent on the principles of support and leadership by state agencies, in a collaborative setting, utilizing incentives, and financial assistance to the extent possible. 
7.4. Recommendations to the State 
The Altamaha Council supports the concept of regional water resource planning with a focus on planning Councils composed of local governments, water users, water providers, industry, business, and affected stakeholders. Local representatives are typically most familiar with local water resource issues and needs. The State has a vital role providing technical support, guidance, and funding to support locally focused water resource planning. This Plan should be viewed as a living, iterative document and the State should focus on the following principles: 
Education, Incentives, Collaboration, Cooperation, Enabling, Supporting 
The Altamaha Council is sensitive to unintended consequences if Plan recommendations become mandates. The State must help balance Plan recommendations with assessing measurable progress toward Plan implementation. If additional rules or other administrative or regulatory actions are deemed necessary, the State should work with Councils to help ensure workable solutions. 
The following specific recommendations to the State are provided to help aid in the successful implementation of the Plan. 
Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) 
. 	Consider “institutionalizing” planning. This would entail a long-term commitment of staff and funding to: monitor and support Plan recommendations; coordinate improved data collection, management and analysis; continue to develop and improve Resource Assessment tools; and help provide funding, permitting and technical support to address gaps and water resource needs. 
. 	Work with Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission, Georgia Department of Agriculture, University of Georgia, and other relevant institutions to improve agricultural water use data collection and management. This effort would focus on refining source(s) of supply for multiple irrigation sources, continuing to assess data on crop water requirements, evaluating the effects of farm ponds on direct irrigation withdrawals and the hydrologic cycle, and further research on crop consumptive use. This data in turn should be coordinated with Resource Assessment tools to ensure accurate simulation of any gaps and assumptions. 
7-28 	September 2011 

. 	Focus funding support and permitting assistance to projects and programs aimed at addressing gap areas. Where possible, leverage federal funds to help support and expedite project implementation. 
. 	Consider collaborative approaches to collecting more standardized water use data and improving data on water demands. This would include continued improvement and updating databases used in the planning process. It would also involve working with the Georgia Municipal Association, Georgia Association of County Commissioners, and other relevant stakeholders to improve water use information. 
. 	Working with Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, examine opportunities to improve coordination among water providers and users and create incentives to maximize existing infrastructure and coordinated operations. 
. 	Continue to engage in dialogue and data-sharing with the States of Florida and South Carolina regarding current and forecasted groundwater use. South Georgia, North Florida, and South Carolina rely on the Upper Floridan Aquifer to meet water supply needs and it is in EPD’s best interest to include the most accurate available information on growth and groundwater use in both states in the Resource Assessment modeling. 
Georgia Environmental Finance Authority (GEFA) 
. 	Meeting forecasted water supply needs will require stable and flexible funding sources to assist water users and water and wastewater utilities in meeting forecasted needs. A stable GEFA financing source(s) should be provided for necessary water supply, water and wastewater plant construction and plant upgrades to address current and future gaps. 
Georgia Forestry Commission (GFC) 
. 	Continue to support and fund the GFC Forestry Best Management Practices Program. Providing education and incentives to control erosion and segmentation will help the region prevent/address TMDL listed segments, reduce nutrient loadings, and support wetland areas. This will have the benefit of helping to sustain baseflow conditions of streams and water quality. 
Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission (GSWCC) 
GSWCC should continue to provide leadership and locally focused efforts in the following programs: 
. 	Continue education and outreach associated with Urban Erosion and Sediment Control program including certification of individuals involved in land disturbing activities and on-site implementation of erosion,

September 2011 	7-29 

sedimentation, and pollution control plans. This will help address the water quality needs of the region. 
. 	Continue education and outreach efforts to agricultural interests through annual Irrigation Meetings and other avenues to inform farmers of available technologies and funding sources to make more efficient use of water resources without incurring hardship. 
. 	Support completion, maintenance and improvement of the Agricultural Water Use Measurement Program, which is aimed at cost effectively collecting agricultural water use data across the State, and integrating cooperative arrangements with the private sector and partnerships with other State agencies. This program is a vital component to helping the State and regions effectively manage and utilize water resources. 
. Support Georgia Agricultural Conservation Incentive program, which provides funding support to help implement conservation practices that benefit water quantity and quality. Funding for this program is essential to help implement conservation measures, especially in the regional watersheds where there are surface water gaps. 
Office of State Planning and Budget (OPB) 
. 	Obtain population census data and compare to population forecasts to track trends in the accuracy of population projections 
. 	Revise population forecasts and support ongoing state-wide planning 
Department of Community Affairs (DCA) 
. 	Identify and encourage local governments to integrate Regional Water Plan management practices with land use and water quality/quantity nexuses into their comprehensive planning efforts. 
. 	Continue to promote coordinated environmental planning 
Georgia Department of Agriculture (DOA) 
. 	Provide technical information and participate in needed studies to better characterize agricultural water uses and quantification of shortages to low flow conditions. 
. 	Assist with outreach and education of agricultural users to obtain greater understanding of surface water resource limitations, both quality and quantity, and to help improve the implementation rate of management practices. Assist EPD and other state agencies in coordinating accomplishment of the above goals with the Georgia Farm Bureau. 
7-30 	September 2011 

Georgia Department of Natural Resources [Coastal Resources Division (CRD) and Wildlife Resources Division (WRD)] 
. 	Continue to monitor resources and help sustain, enhance, protect and conserve Georgia’s natural, historic, and cultural resources. 
. 	Provide technical and ecosystem information to help support state water planning needs.

8. MONITORING AND REPORTING PROGRESS 


Section 8. Monitoring and Reporting Progress 
The selected water management practices identified in Section 6 will be primarily implemented (as described in Section 7) by the various water users in the region, including local governments and others with the capacity to develop water infrastructure and apply for the required permits, grants and loans. 
8.1. Benchmarks 
The benchmarks prepared by the Altamaha Council and listed in Table 8-1 below will be used to assess the effectiveness of this Plan’s implementation and identify any required revisions. As detailed below, the Altamaha Council selected both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks that will be used to assess whether the water management practices are closing gaps over time and allowing the water planning region to meet its Vision and Goals. Effective implementation of the Plan will require the availability of sufficient funding in the form of loans, and in some cases, possibly grants. In addition, many of the proposed management practices require ongoing coordination with affected stakeholders/water users and collaboration to help ensure successful solutions are identified and implemented. Finally, in many cases monitoring progress toward addressing future needs will require improved data and information on the current actions and management practices that are already in place. The benchmarks will be used to evaluate the Regional Water Plan effectiveness at the next 5-year Plan review and will require collection of information in the intervening years to better quantify and document resource conditions and progress to meeting regional needs and goals. The successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan will require both leadership and supporting roles by EPD, other state agencies, local government and water and wastewater utilities, as well as individual water users.

8.2. Plan Updates 
Meeting current and future water needs will require periodic review and revision of Regional Water Plans. The State Water Plan and associated rules provide that each Regional Water Plan will be subject to review by the appropriate Regional Water Planning Council every five years and in accordance with this guidance provided by the Director, unless otherwise required by the Director for earlier review. These reviews and updates will allow an opportunity to adapt the Regional Water Plan based on changed circumstances and new information arising in the five years after EPD’s adoption of these plans. These benchmarks will guide EPD in the review of the Regional Water Plan.  
The Councils appointed to prepare future Regional Water Plan updates will have the opportunity to review the recommendations of past Plans against current available data to make a determination as to which management practices are still appropriate and which ones need to be revised or augmented to meet changing conditions. Future Councils will also have the ability to judge the effectiveness of practices recommended in previous Plans against available benchmark data. This analysis will reveal which practices are effective and what adjustments are necessary to compensate for less effective practices. 
8.3. Plan Amendments 
The Altamaha Council emphasizes that the recommendations in this Regional Water Plan are based on the best information available at the time the Plan was written. New information and issues that may impact the recommendations should be considered and incorporated into relevant implementation decisions and future Water Plan updates. Future planning efforts should confirm current assumptions and make necessary revisions and/or improvements to the conclusions reached during this round of planning.
