 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

[This Page Intentionally Left Blank] 

Executive Summary 
Executive Summary 
The first Comprehensive State-wide Water Management Plan (State Water Plan) was adopted by the Georgia General Assembly in January 2008. The State Water Plan included a provision to create 10 water planning regions across the state, each guided by a regional water planning council. An eleventh Council, Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District, encompassing the Atlanta metro area already existed. 
The State Water Plan required the 
preparation of regional water 
development and conservation plans 
(Regional Water Plans) to manage 
water resources in a sustainable 
manner through 2050 incorporating 
input from state agencies, other 
regional water planning councils, local 
governments, watershed 
stakeholders, and the public. 

The Middle Chattahoochee Regional Water Planning Council (the Council), was charged with developing this Regional Water Plan. The Council was comprised of 30 individuals from throughout the planning region which includes 11 counties and 34 incorporated municipalities. A total of eleven full council meetings were held to develop the Regional Water Plan over a 30-month period. 
Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Region 
The majority of the Middle Chattahoochee planning region is part of the Apalachicola­Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) River Basin and is comprised of the Chattahoochee and Flint Rivers that converge at Lake Seminole on the Georgia-Florida state line to form the Apalachicola River. In addition, both Carroll and Haralson counties have areas that are in the headwaters of the Tallapoosa River basin.

Water resources of the planning region support various instream uses including navigation, recreation, treated wastewater assimilation, and environmental uses while major reservoirs are also extremely important to the region and provide system storage for flood control, recreation, and hydropower generation. 
Throughout the planning process, there was strong recognition by the Council that the water resources in the ACF River Basin are highly complex with significant political and environmental issues that remain unresolved. Several rulings on the consolidated litigation between the Corps of Engineers, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida disputing Corps operations of the federal reservoirs were made during the plan development. In addition, EPA issued new nutrient standards for free flowing streams and lakes in Florida, which may have substantial implications for water quality management in this region. 

Planning Process 
At the beginning of the planning process, the Middle Chattahoochee Council developed a Vision statement supported by specific goals including such things as protecting the quantity, quality, and environmental resources of ACF system in the face of political, climate variability, and economic uncertainties. The vision and goals guided the Council in developing this Regional Water Plan particularly the selection of management practices as outlined in Section 6. 
After completing the vision and goals, the next step in the planning process was to identify and quantify demands for water in the basin. With input from various stakeholders, support from EPD and using population projections provided by the Office of Planning and Budget, regional water and wastewater projections were developed thru 2050. With the region’s population almost doubling (91.3% increase) by 2050, and with increasing efforts to conserve water, water needs are forecast to increase significantly as shown in the figure below.  

Agricultural water needs are projected to increase by approximately 10% by 2050. Findings of this analysis also show that municipal and industrial water uses are primarily supplied from surface water while agriculture in the region generally relies on the use of ground water. 
MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE

As part of the statewide water planning process, EPD developed water availability and water quality Resource Assessments (RA) for the State’s river basins and aquifers to evaluate the capacity of water resources to meet current and future demands for water supply and wastewater assimilation without causing unreasonable impacts. Potential shortcomings based on the results of these RA are classified as “gaps.” A gap means that the existing or future conditions exceeded a RA metric, e.g., the sustainable yield of a specific groundwater aquifer is exceeded, thus, a potential “gap” exists in groundwater availability in that area.  The Council disagreed with the definition of the surface water availability gaps, as the assessment methodology did not consider desired river flows at specific locations and did not prioritize lake level.  The three resource assessments with both current and future results summarized are shown in the following table.

Executive Summary 
Resource Assessments with Summarized Current and Future Results  
Resource Assessments  Description  Current Results  Future Results  
Surface Water Availability  Modeled the ability of surface water resources to meet current needs without substantially altering the hydrologic flow regime.  Results in the Chattahoochee basin show significant “gaps” (see note 1) between available water and minimum lake levels to meet authorized purposes and river flows (see Table 5-1).  Current USACOE operation of the system is inadequate. Water availability gaps were also identified in the Tallapoosa and Little Tallapoosa basins.  Results in the Chattahoochee basin show significant “gaps” (see note 1) between available water and minimum lake levels to meet authorized purposes and river flows (see Table 5-1).  Current USACOE operation of the system is inadequate. Water availability gaps were also identified in the Tallapoosa and Little Tallapoosa basins.  
Groundwater Availability  Modeled the sustainable yield for prioritized groundwater aquifers.  Results for the Claiborne aquifer indicate that the existing withdrawals are generally lower than the sustainable yield range.   The results showed that future projected use is within the sustainable yield of the Claiborne aquifer.  
Surface Water Quality  Measures the capacity of Georgia’s surface waters to assimilate pollutants without unacceptable degradation of water  The results found that most of the region had available assimilative capacity in terms of dissolved oxygen.  The watershed modeling identified that point sources contributed a higher amount of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) than nonpoint sources  The results showed some specific reaches where dissolved oxygen levels under future conditions needed improvement, and increased levels of nutrient discharges, both of which, while impacted by nonpoint source

Notes: 1. ”Gap” as defined by the Georgia EPD for the surface water availability resource assessment does not account for dramatically reduced lake levels that have been lowered to augment mandated river flows.  

MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE 

The results of the resource assessment for Groundwater Availability shows the current and projected uses are within the sustainable yield of this resource. 
The results of the Surface Water Quality resource assessment show that point­source discharges impact nutrient loadings more than non-point sources.  At the 2050 modeled conditions, a significant increase in nutrients at the Whitesburg gage is projected, originating from the upper Chattahoochee region.  Long term, contributions of nitrogen and phosphorus will need to decrease in order to improve water quality. 
In regard to Surface Water Availability, the Council identified significant “gaps” between desired lake levels and river flows citing specific objections to the current operations of the Chattahoochee system as operated by the USACOE under the Revised Interim Operations Plan (RIOP). The Council identified the need for an improved operating plan for the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) Basin 
ES-4 

which better balances the multiple authorized purposes of the federally operated reservoirs and addresses impacts on instream uses throughout the basin. 


Recommended Management Practices 
Since gaps were identified, the Council identified and recommended three water conservation, two returns management, six supply management, three instream use management, and eight water quality management practices.  The Council prioritized the management practice recommendations, with the following practices identified as the highest priority.  
Recommended management practices also had benchmarks identified, where appropriate, that would enable the demonstration of compliance and progress in the future. 
The Council also voiced a number of recommendations to the state. These included the following: 
. 	asking the State to advocate for council-recommended changes to the USACOE Water Control Manual, 
. 	improving water demand forecasting for energy and Alabama, documenting metro Atlanta returns, 
. 	studying scientifically based minimum flow targets, considering additional groundwater development, 
. 	developing increased storage,  
. 	studying additional water conservation measures, increasing funding for improved resource assessments and implementation of management practices, and  

MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE

. considering creating local water management agencies.

Of particular note is that through discussions with the adjacent Flint basin water councils, several coordinated recommendations were emphasized. Council coordination is considered an important ongoing need for future rounds of planning.

1. INTRODUCTION 

[This Page Intentionally Left Blank] 

Section 1. Introduction 
1.1. The Significance of Water Resources in Georgia 
Of all Georgia's natural resources, none is more important to the future of our state than water. The wise use and management of water is critical to support the state's economy, to protect public health and natural systems, and to enhance the quality of life for all citizens. 
Georgia has abundant water resources, with fourteen major river systems (Figure 1­1) and multiple groundwater aquifer systems. These waters are shared natural resources. Streams and rivers run through many political jurisdictions. The rain that falls in one region of Georgia may replenish the aquifers used by communities many miles away. And, while water in Georgia is abundant, it is not an unlimited resource. It must be carefully managed to meet long-term water needs. 
Since water resources, their conditions, and their uses vary greatly across the state, selection and implementation of management practices on a regional and local level is the most effective way to ensure that current and future needs for water supply and assimilative capacity are met. 
Therefore, the State Water Plan called for the preparation of regional water development and conservation plans (Regional Water Plans) for the ten water planning regions, outside of the Metropolitan Atlanta area, depicted in Figure 1-1. (The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District (MNGWPD) has a separate water planning process created by the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District Act of 2001.)  This Regional Water Plan prepared for the Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Region by the Middle Chattahoochee Regional Water Planning Council describes the regionally appropriate water management practices to be employed in Georgia's Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Region over the next 40 years. 

1.2. State and Regional Water Planning Process 
The State Water Plan calls for the preparation of regional water plans designed to manage water resources in a sustainable manner through 2050. It establishes ten regional water planning councils and provides a framework for regional planning consistent with the policy statement that "Georgia manages water resources in a sustainable manner to support the state's economy, to protect public health and natural systems, and to enhance the quality of life for all citizens."

This regional water plan has been prepared following the consensus-based planning process illustrated in Figure 1-2. As detailed in Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council's Memorandum of Understanding with EPD and DCA as well as the Council's Public Involvement Plan1 , the process required and benefited from input of other regional water planning councils, local governments, and the public. 


1.3. The Middle Chattahoochee Regional Vision and Goals 
The Council developed a regional vision statement to describe the planning region's water future. The Council adopted the following vision statement: 
1 See the Memorandum of Agreement & Public Participation Technical Memorandum available on the Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Region's website. <http://www.middlechattahoochee.org/pages/our plan/Middle Chattahoochee Supplemental Material. php> 
00.U u:<.. <:00u:ww 


1. Introduction 

Our vision is that our descendants have safe, clean and abundant water to meet their needs in the Middle Chattahoochee Region; seeking to accomplish that through reasonable efforts in cooperation, education, and preservation. 
After developing the vision, the Middle Chattahoochee Council developed specific goals to support this vision which were as follows: 
1. 
Political -The plan will provide the technical basis to help resolve the issues pertaining to water resources management and competing interests. 

2. 
Uncertainties - The plan will provide guidance for effective policies and appropriate actions during drought, economic uncertainty, regulatory or political influences, and affects of climate variability. 

3. 
River System -The Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) river systems are a unique asset within the region. The management of the rivers and their uses (hydropower, navigation, water quality, water supply, flood control, fish and wildlife conservation, recreation and cooling water for nuclear and coal fired power plants) are vital to the region. The plan will recommend adjustments to the management directives and uses of the river systems in order to achieve a balance of future water requirements within the region. 

4. 
Land Use Changes - The plan will acknowledge the increasing tax value of land and resulting trends: increasing urbanization, fewer natural forests, and decreasing agricultural land. However the plan will seek to encourage agricultural land and forest land conservation by providing for their water requirements. 

5. 
Water Balance - The plan will provide a better understanding of water balance and consumptive use and clearly define returns to surface water, the need for storage, and provide guidance for the increasing trend for groundwater usage. 

6. 	
Population - The plan will address the water needs for an increasing [resident] population as well the increased transient population at such locations as Fort Benning. 

7. 
Quantity and Quality -The plan will establish the necessary goals to achieve water quality and quantity throughout the Middle Chattahoochee basin. 

8. 	
Conservation I Green -The plan will encourage forest, agriculture and open land and habitat preservation. It will also encourage cost effective alternative energy sources, water conservation, and sustained protection of habitat and natural resources.

The Council's vision and goals were adopted in order to guide the Council in developing this Regional Water Plan. While the Council does not directly manage water resources in the region, the vision and goals address resource management in order to indicate the Council's priorities and inform Council decision-making in the planning process. The regional vision and goals were used by the Council to guide the selection of water management practices, which are discussed in Section ..

2. 	THE MIDDLE CHATTACHOOCHEE WATER PLANNING REGION 
[This Page Intentionally Left Blank] 

Section 2. The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Region 
2.1. Geography 
The Middle Chattahoochee water planning region encompasses over 3,760 square miles in west-central Georgia and includes 11 counties (Carroll, Chattahoochee, Clay, Haralson, Harris, Heard, Muscogee, Quitman, Randolph, Stewart, and Troup) as well as approximately 34 towns and cities partially or fully within these counties. Major regional river basins include the Chattahoochee, Flint, and Tallapoosa. 
The majority of the Middle Chattahoochee planning region is part of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) River Basin. The ACF River Basin drains about 19,800 square miles in western Georgia, eastern Alabama, and the Florida panhandle, and is comprised of the Chattahoochee and Flint Rivers that converge at Lake Seminole on the Georgia-Florida state line to form the Apalachicola River1. The Apalachicola River flows south through the Florida panhandle into Apalachicola Bay, which discharges into the Gulf of Mexico.  
Basin hydrology is influenced by 16 major reservoirs that cause approximately half of the mainstem river miles to be in backwater, and play a major role in controlling flow and influencing the quality of water in the basin. Along the 400 miles of Chattahoochee River between Lake Seminole and Lake Lanier, over 300 miles are measured across reservoirs. The Corps of Engineers operates the five federal reservoir projects on the Chattahoochee River. Privately-owned hydroelectric impoundments are regulated through licensing requirements established by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Currently, five FERC projects are licensed in the ACF basin for seven small to medium-sized impoundments (Morgan Falls Dam, Lake Harding, Goat Rock Lake, Lake Oliver, North Highland Lake, Lake Blackshear and Lake Chehaw). 
The headwaters of the Tallapoosa River are located in Paulding (Metro North Georgia District), a small portion of Polk (Coosa-North Georgia Water Planning

Region) and Haralson counties. The Little Tallapoosa River originates in Carroll County and the two rivers converge in northeastern Alabama and further downstream combine with the Coosa River near Wetumpka, Alabama to form the Alabama River. The Alabama River and Tombigbee River converge to form the Mobile River which flows through southwestern Alabama into Mobile Bay, which discharges into the Gulf of Mexico. This drainage network forms the 22,800 square mile Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa Basin (ACT).  Hundreds of reservoirs are located throughout the ACT Basin, but 18 (6 federal and 12 non-federal) are located on three principal rivers: the Alabama, Coosa, and Tallapoosa Rivers or their major tributaries.2 
The Tallapoosa River Basin drains about 4,680 square miles, of which 720 square miles (15 percent) lie in Georgia, and 3,960 square miles (85 percent) lie in Alabama.3 Four non-federal mainstem reservoirs have been constructed by the Alabama Power Company on the Tallapoosa River including: Lake Harris, Lake Martin, Lake Yates, and Lake Thurlow. No major impoundments or dams are currently located on the Tallapoosa or Little Tallapoosa Rivers in Georgia.   
The Middle Chattahoochee water planning region is bisected by the geographic fall line splitting regions into two distinctive physiographic regions, the piedmont and coastal plain. The City of Columbus in Muscogee County generally represents the centroid of the fall line in the Middle Chattahoochee water planning region. The fall line as a geographic boundary is approximately twenty miles wide with elevation dropping nearly 200 feet. This relatively rapid change in topography is the primary reason for the concentrated grouping of hydropower dams (see Figure 2-1) in the Middle Chattahoochee region. The piedmont physiographic region is characterized by gently rolling topography. At the fall line, metamorphic rock and clayey soils give way to sedimentary rock and sandy soils. The coastal plain physiographic region, south of the fall line is underlain by relatively soft, weakly consolidated rocks and unconsolidated sediments deposited by the sea or streams when the shoreline was at or near the fall line between 80 and 100 million years ago4 . 
The Middle Chattahoochee and surrounding regions are underlain by five major aquifer systems: crystalline-rock aquifers in the Blue Ridge and Piedmont physiographic provinces north of the fall line and four aquifers in the Coastal Plain physiographic province south of the fall line, including the Cretaceous, Clayton, Claiborne, and Floridan aquifer systems. The southern portion of the Middle Chattahoochee Region (Clay, Quitman, and Randolph counties), all located below the fall line, exhibit karstic topography (formed via the dissolution of layers of soluble

bedrock, typically limestone). The greatest use and recharge of groundwater for the Middle Chattahoochee Planning Region occurs here. The interaction between surface and groundwater in the basin is not fully understood, especially in regard to recharge, connectivity, water quality, lake influence on groundwater levels and drought effects. 
Approximately 74 percent of the drainage area of the ACF Basin and 23 percent of the ACT Basin are in Georgia5. Georgians are highly dependent upon these basins in a variety of ways. The Chattahoochee River, including Lake Lanier, is the primary source of water supply for the metropolitan north Georgia region6 as well as for many Georgians downstream. Lake Allatoona and the rivers and streams of the ACT Basin are another major source of water supply to metropolitan Atlanta as well as the City of Rome and other communities in Georgia. The ACF Basin in Georgia is a rich agricultural region, and Georgia’s farmers rely upon its surface and ground waters for irrigation. The waters of the ACF and ACT Basins support a rich diversity of fish and wildlife species. 
The federal reservoirs in the ACF and ACT Basins are among the nation’s most visited for recreation, and Lake Lanier and West Point Lake alone have been estimated to contribute well in excess of several billion dollars in annual revenue attributable to recreation. Federal dams and reservoirs also produce hydropower and provide limited support for commercial navigation7,8. The region with its water resources are summarized in Figure 2-1. Dams in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) are summarized in Table 2-1.

2.2. Characteristics of the Region 
The region has an exceptional quality of life with diverse and growing mix of business and industry. Major employers include Southwire in Carroll County, Cagles and Callaway Gardens in Harris County and the new Kia Motor Corporations manufacturing plant in Troup County. The 2009 opening of the Kia Motors new operation in West Point represents an investment of more than one billion dollars; 
MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE 

September 2011 

the plant is predicted to produce 300,000 vehicles per year. Additional regional employment is anticipated from the suppliers to the new plant, representing 4,100 jobs and $830 million in investments9. At a newly opened, 350,000 square foot industrial plant in Columbus, Georgia, NCR Corporation manufactures automated teller machines that will add 870 jobs over the next 5 years. Aflac is a Fortune 500 company based in Columbus with annual revenues at the end of 2009 of $18 billion that employs over 8,000 people. 
Fort Benning in Chattahoochee and Muscogee Counties is an important military training facility and regional economic engine. The base is reported to have trained 115,000 military personal and awarded $250 million in contracts in 2009. The Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) and other military structure changes will generate $25-$35 million more regional contract dollars per month in the near future10. By September 2011 nearly $3.5 billion in capital investment will have been made and the number of trained personnel will increase to nearly 146,000 troops per year. Two public universities and colleges located within the region, including the University of West Georgia in Carroll County and Columbus State University in Muscogee County, create a combined total annual economic impact of $362 million11. LaGrange College in Troup County also provides employment and economic benefits to the region. 
The Corps operation of five federal reservoirs greatly affects the regional ecology, economy and social context. As an example of local economic impact, at full pool (elevation 635 feet above mean sea level) West Point Lake funnels an estimated $710 million a year from direct and indirect spending into the regional economy. At 630 feet, the estimated impact from the lake contributes only $154 million a year12 . 
Land use in the Middle Chattahoochee water planning region is predominantly forested; however, urban centers have experienced tremendous growth over the past 20 years. Regional land use estimates for 2005 are summarized in Figure 2-2.

2.3. Local Policy Context 
The water resources in the ACF River Basin are highly complex and there are significant political and environmental issues that remain unresolved.  
At the time this plan is being written, several rulings have been issued on the consolidated litigation between the Corps of Engineers, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida disputing Corps operations of the federal reservoirs.  
Public dialog between Georgia, Florida and Alabama in regard to water allocation and water planning has been limited. As an example, while representatives from Alabama and Georgia have discussed the need for Alabama’s future water demand forecasts in the basin, such forecasts are unavailable. Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) would only provide current consumptive demands and these were obtained by EPD through the Corps of Engineers (not directly from ADEM to EPD). 
Flow targets, lake levels, and environmental flows along the river are not agreed upon between the three states. Corps operating practices for the river system and uses of the projects have been challenged in State and Federal court. Rulings issued by Federal Courts at the time of this writing indicate much of the Corps’ current operating plans are inadequate and new plans are under development. 
MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE 

September 2011 

With regard to water quality regulation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signed final nutrient standards for free flowing streams and lakes in Florida13 as a result of a federal lawsuit under the Clean Water Act. As promulgated, these criteria require increased control of nutrients in Georgia in order to meet downstream standards. These new nutrient standards, scheduled to take effect on March 6, 2012, may impact water quality management in this region and other regions with river systems that cross into Florida. The state of Florida has filed a federal lawsuit challenging the agency’s final rule on the grounds that “the rule and the agency’s necessity determination for promulgating nutrient criteria were arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.”14 
With this local policy context as a backdrop, the Middle Chattahoochee Water Council began this planning process in 2009. At the outset, it became clear that the plan would be based on the current scenarios due to the uncertainties of the outcome of political and environmental issues. 
2.3.1 Corps of Engineers Reservoir Operations 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps of Engineers) Mobile District operates five federal reservoir projects on the Chattahoochee River: Buford Dam (Lake Lanier), West Point Dam, Walter F. George Lock and Dam, George W. Andrews Lock and Dam, and Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam (Lake Seminole). These are multi-purpose projects for which operations have been congressionally authorized (see Table 2-1). 
The Corp of Engineer’s ACF operations are guided by a Master Water Control Manual. The manual is intended to set operational guidelines to “achieve and balance all authorized project purposes” by operating the federal projects as a system15 . 
In the absence of an updated Master Water Control Manual, the Corp of Engineers has been operating the ACF Basin under a set of guidelines currently referred to as the Revised Interim Operation Plan (RIOP). The RIOP is intended to govern the releases from Woodruff Dam until replaced with a new Master Water Control Manual. The RIOP was formulated to address protection of endangered and threatened species and critical habitat in the Apalachicola River, manage reservoir storage for other project purposes, and meet drought contingencies.

MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE 


The RIOP defined four action zones for Buford, West Point, and Walter F. George that were intended to address the use of conservation storage in conjunction with operation of the other two federal reservoirs in the system (Lakes Andrews and Seminole). The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council has identified that the action zone values as developed contradict and compromise authorized purposes, specifically, recreational use at West Point Lake.  
Also according to the RIOP, the Corps of Engineers must provide a minimum release from the Woodruff Lock and Dam at Lake Seminole of 5,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) to address protection of endangered and threatened species and critical habitat in the Apalachicola River. This flow target can be reduced to 4,500 cfs when the storage left in the three major storage reservoirs on the Chattahoochee fall below the total composite storage of Action Zone 4. The 5,000 cfs minimum release is not agreed upon between the three states, yet greatly impacts the surface water and water quality assessment performed as part of the regional water planning effort.  
As a matter of record for the Middle Chattahoochee Council’s Regional Water Plan, it should be made clear that the Master Water Control Manual update had not been issued at the time of the plan finalization in September 2011. An update to the master water control manual is expected to be published in 2012 as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers responds to the court’s directions in the ongoing litigation; however, the exact schedule is unknown at this point.  Further details regarding the Master Water Control Manual update are provided in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Water Control Manual Status supplemental document available on the Middle Chattahoochee website16 and on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ website. 
It should also be noted that the Middle Chattahoochee Water Council has made clear that the 1989 Water Control Plan and the current RIOP are both inadequate.  In fact, the Council has stated that these operational practices contribute to many of the river and lake problems that cause social, economic, biological and supply and quality impacts along the Chattahoochee. It is the Council’s expectation that the revised Master Water Control Manual will put forth significant operational changes contemplated to address the gaps.

3. 	WATER RESOURCES OF OF THE MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE REGION 
[This Page Intentionally Left Blank] 

Section 3. Water Resources of the Middle Chattahoochee Region 
This section summarizes the major water uses in the region, the current conditions from the resource assessments, and provides a summary of ecosystem conditions. 
The Chattahoochee River Basin, including the river, its tributaries, headwater and tributary streams, and its underlying groundwater, is intensively utilized for numerous purposes. The watershed is vital to the region with nearly 75 percent of the Middle Chattahoochee region within the basin. Its waters are withdrawn to supply water for cities and counties, industry, thermoelectric power generation and agriculture. Equally important, however, are its instream uses, defined in the state-wide water plan as "all those human and ecological uses which occur within the banks of rivers and streams, including waste assimilation, hydropower production, recreation, maintenance of aquatic habitats, and support of biological integrity. 1 Presently, the demands in the Chattahoochee basin are exceeding its ability to meet the many competing uses and requirements. The ongoing federal litigation is only one example that the interests in the basin are competing for a limited resource.  
Approximately 9 percent of the land area in the region falls in the Flint River Basin, primarily in Randolph County. This area is primarily agricultural, with irrigation withdrawals from both surface water and groundwater sources. The Tallapoosa River Basin, accounting for nearly 16 percent of regional land area, is a vital municipal and industrial supply for Haralson and Carroll counties.  
A first step in the planning process is to identify and quantify the demands for water in the basin. A key outcome of this plan aims to reconcile the supply and competing demand for water through structural and non-structural measures, to ensure that the watershed retains its capacity to meet competing needs, and to steer water use in directions that are economically, socially, and environmentally responsible.  
3.1. Water Withdrawal Uses in the Region 
Current water withdrawal use information in this region was developed as a part of the development of water forecasts for different water use categories. Water withdrawal is defined as the removal of water from a natural water body, such as river, stream or aquifer2,3. Consumptive use is defined as the difference between the

September 2011 

total amount of water withdrawn from a defined hydrologic system and the total 
4.
amount of the withdrawn water that is returned to the same hydrologic system
Water withdrawal use categories included municipal, industrial, energy, and agriculture. 
• 	
Municipal supply water use is water withdrawn by public and private water suppliers and delivered for a variety of uses. Water-using industries were compiled separately in the "industrial category. 

• 	
Industrial water use includes fabrication, processing, washing, and cooling for facilities that manufacture products, including steel, chemical and allied products, paper, and mining. 

• 	
Energy water use includes water used in the generation of thermoelectric power, mainly for cooling purposes (water for hydroelectric power is discussed later). 

• 	
Agriculture includes row and orchard crops as well as most vegetable and specialty crops. Nursery and golf course irrigation water use estimates were also included. Animal livestock water use was estimated for current conditions but was not included in the forecasts. 


When discussing consumptive water use in the Chattahoochee Basin, it is important to consider the Alabama demands. Current demand values were provided to EPD from the Corps of Engineers. A summary of these demands and associated users represented by those quantities is summarized in Table 3-1.

Surface water is the major source of water for the region as shown in Figure 3-1. Two major uses for surface water include Municipal and Energy use categories as shown in Figure 3-2. The majority of groundwater water use in the region is for agricultural production as shown in Figure 3-3. 
Different means of wastewater treatment and disposal result in different levels of flow returned to the hydrologic system. The three categories of wastewater treatment and disposal are defined below: 
• 	
On-Site Sewage Management Systems {septic systems): Include sewage 

management systems other than a public or community sewage treatment system that serves one or more buildings, mobile homes, recreational vehicles, residences, or other facilities designed or used for human occupancy, and which is permitted by a local county board of health under rules promulgated by the Department of Community Health. 

• 	
Land Application System {LAS): Any method of disposing of pollutants in which pollutants are applied to the surface or beneath the surface of a parcel of land and which results in the pollutants percolating, infiltrating, or being absorbed into the soil and then into the waters of the state. 

• 	
Point Source Discharge: A "point source" is defined as "any discernible confined and discrete conveyance including, but not limited to, a pipe, ditch, channel, or conduit from which pollutants are or may be discharged. 


Only point source discharges are expected to return flows to the hydrologic system in a timely manner. Land application and on-site sewage management systems are

3.2. Instream Water Uses in the Region 
Current instream uses in the region significantly impact the region's economy and quality of life for the region. Major regional instream uses include hydropower, flood control, navigation, recreation, fish and wildlife protection, and sport fishing. 
• 	
.ydropower utilization in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) Basin is significant, with approximately 724 megawatts of installed capacity in the Chattahoochee River and 21 megawatts installed in the Flint River. 

In total, the Chattahoochee River has four federal and five private dams used for the production of energy while two private impoundments are located in the Flint River. Several hydropower projects are located within the Middle Chattahoochee planning region, with the largest generating installations at Bartletts Ferry Dam (impounding Lake Harding), Walter F. George Dam, and West Point Dam. 

• 	
Flood control is a congressionally authorized purpose for the three large federal reservoir projects on the Chattahoochee River (Lake Lanier, West Point Lake, and Lake Walter F. George). Flood management of the federal reservoirs currently mandates that during winter months the lakes be drawn down to provide adequate flood storage. 

The timing and the extent of seasonal drawdown operation is currently established via seasonal action zones established within each major federal storage project. The level to which each lake is reduced is a function of inflow at certain periods of the year, drainage area, surface area, and the anticipated climatologic conditions anticipated in the coming months. 

• 	
avigation is one of the congressionally authorized purposes of the federal reservoir projects on the Chattahoochee River. The head of navigation begins at Columbus and extends south to Apalachicola Bay. 


Maintaining this navigational channel is the responsibility of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which currently maintains a nine-foot deep by 100-foot wide channel from Columbus to the mouth of the Apalachicola River. Flow control is provided by upstream reservoirs. 
Navigation is important to the regional economy and must be maintained between Columbus and Apalachicola Bay. 
• 	Recreation is an authorized purpose of West Point Lake and a stated purpose of other federal reservoir projects. Several of the larger non-federal hydroelectric impoundments also offer public access for recreational opportunities, including shoreline access for water sports such as swimming, boating, sailing, water and jet skiing, and fishing. With a diverse and easily 
00.U_u:<  <:00u:ww_ 

_
September 2011 

accessible river environment, the Chattahoochee River also provides opportunities for boating and fishing. 
West Point Lake, a major recreational reservoir, "was developed as a demonstration project for the purpose of providing a wider variety of recreational facilities and opportunities for the public than normally provided at Corps lakes . 5 Lake levels directly impact the ability to provide for its designated recreational purpose which, as discussed in Section 2, can have a dramatic effect on the regional economy. 
•	
 Sport Fishing within the region is managed by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Wildlife Resources Division and the U.S Army Corps of Engineers. At the state level, the Fisheries Management Section of the Wildlife Resources Division manages lakes, warm water streams, and trout streams for sport fishing, surveys fish populations to determine sound management approaches and set regulations, constructs and maintains public boat ramps and fish attractors, investigates pollution and fish kills, reviews environmental impact reports, provides technical assistance to environmental agencies, operates fish hatcheries and Public Fishing Areas (PFAs) and sponsors youth fishing events. Fishing is enjoyed throughout the region and anglers have ample opportunity to fish in the area's many streams and lakes. Angling opportunities in the lakes include catfish, bream, black crappie, striped bass, and largemouth bass. The Department of Natural Resources manages State Parks and Historic sites, one Public Fishing Area, and three Wildlife Management Areas in the region. 

• 	
Boating opportunities in the region are abundant in the federal and private reservoirs. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District is planning to remove two existing dams on the Chattahoochee River near Columbus, Georgia. Removal of the City Mills and Eagle and Phenix Dams would provide additional shoal habitat and unimpounded river habitat from the tailwater below North Highlands Dam downstream to the backwaters of Lake Walter F. George. An engineered whitewater course is envisioned to be constructed, which is expected to create 700 jobs and draw over 180,000 visitors annually to this section of the river. Construction is expected to begin in 2011, and once the project is completed, it will be one of the largest urban whitewater courses in the country. 

•	
 Wildlife management areas are located along the shores of many federal 


00.U_u:<  <:00u:ww_ 

and non-federal reservoirs, including 10,000 acres located at the northern end of West Point Lake. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages the Eufaula National Wildlife Refuge on the northwest shore of Lake Walter F. George, which provides winter habitat for wintering waterfowl and other migratory birds.

• 	Wastewater Assimilative Capacity, or the capacity and ability of receiving waters to assimilate pollutants, is dependent upon the instream flow quantity available. Instream flow quantities available in the surface water courses within the Middle Chattahoochee region, and the state at large, are used in establishing permit limits for point and nonpoint sources of pollution. 

3.3. Resource Assessments 
Three resource assessments were prepared as part of the regional planning process: 
1. 	
Surface water availability 

2.	
 Groundwater availability 

3. 	
Surface water quality 


These assessments determined the capacity of water resources to meet demands for water supply and wastewater discharge without unreasonable impacts. 
The resource assessments were completed on a resource basis (river basins and aquifers) and the current conditions are summarized here as they relate to the Middle Chattahoochee water planning region. Full details of each resource assessment can be found on the EPD website. Section 5 will describe the future conditions excerpted from the resource assessments. 
In guidance documents by EPD to the Council, it was clear that the resource assessments would use the RIOP and FERC license requirements on the Chattahoochee River to set its metrics for the baseline assessment of surface water availability. The baseline surface water availability assessment therefore does not take into account meeting all of the instream water uses described in Section 3.2. The Council takes exception to this aspect of the planning process and has therefore modified the definition of the term .gap' (used in other statewide water planning documents) to include gaps that are created by failure to meet either water withdrawal uses or instream water uses. 
3.3. Surface Water Availability The Surface Water Availability Assessment estimates the availability of surface water to meet current municipal, industrial, agricultural, and thermoelectric power water needs as well as the needs of instream and downstream users. The assessment determines the reliability of the surface water to meet demands in terms of both magnitude (how much flow would drop below minimum instream requirements) and duration (number of days below minimum instream requirements). Critical inputs for the model include: the desired flow of the river system, expected return of treated wastewater to the system, and the desired water supply. 
The Council notes that unimpaired stream flows were used as a modeling assumption for the surface water availability assessment. In unregulated portions of the basin, flow regime is defined by the State's Interim Instream Flow Protection Policy, which calls for the protection of monthly 7.10 or natural inflow, whichever is 
00.U_u:<  <:00u:ww_ 

_
September 2011 

lower. The Council supports the current DNR policy for water supply permitting. In the regulated portions of the basin, flow regime is limited to locations where an explicit flow requirement is specified, such as by the Corps of Engineers. 
The Chattahoochee and Flint River basins are included in one surface water quantity model; the Tallapoosa River Basin is included in its own model. 
Planning nodes represent locations of interest on the rivers where assessments of surface water availability are performed. The Chattahoochee, Flint and Tallapoosa River Basin planning nodes include the following: 
Tallapoosa Planning Nodes

The first iteration of the Surface Water Availability Assessment was to determine "baseline assessments . Baseline assessments depict the state of the basin under current uses and demands. 
The current conditions model depicts how current water usage and reservoir operation would impact water availability if these factors were held constant over the 1939 to 2007 period of record. Current water usage is explicitly derived from actual, current observed data and not from assumptions or projections about water use. 
00.U_u:<  <:00u:ww_ 

Reservoir operation is that which is currently in effect for the major reservoirs. 
Water availability at unregulated nodes is examined by the percent of time flow is below the adjusted flow regime (AFR), the average shortfall, the long-term average flow, the maximum shortfall, and the flow regime corresponding to the maximum shortfall. Summary statistics for the unregulated and regulated nodes in the Chattahoochee, Flint, and Tallapoosa Basins are presented in Table 3-2 and Table 3-3, respectively. The baseline assessments for regulated nodes were evaluated 
_ 

based on current demands and uses and the current Army Corps of Engineers RIOP. A key criterion for the assessment was the premise that water availability would be measured against the total amount of conservation storage in the reservoir system. If storage could not provide for the current demands and uses, it would be noted as a shortfall, or .gap'. The gaps were expressed as the numeric calculation of the shortfall. 
The baseline (and future) assessments were determined using the available storage in the Federal reservoirs. At the time of this plan, FERC requirements for private, FERC licensed reservoirs did not include drought contingency releases. Future FERC licensing requirements may include some form of drought contingency plans on the part of the permit holder (ex. Bartletts Ferry Dam relicensing6). The Council discussed this during review of the water quantity assessments and concluded that while private reservoir storage is omitted from the analysis at this time, future assessments should consider private reservoir storage during drought conditions consistent with the FERC jurisdiction. 
Unregulated planning node modeling results are presented in Table 3-2. In the Flint River Basin, the anticipated gap is insignificant for the Montezuma node. At Bainbridge, however, there is a much greater shortfall. Flows are below the desired flow target, which means that during such time periods, less flow from the Flint River Basin flows into Lake Seminole to help meet the required seasonal RIOP flows downstream of Woodruff Dam. The Council is seeking collaborative solutions to this problem with both the Upper Flint and Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Regions. Shortfalls in the Tallapoosa River Basin will need to be addressed through the selection and implementation of management practices.

The resource availability of the Chattahoochee River is constrained by multiple instream flow requirements including the following: 
• 	
Whitesburg Planning Node - A minimum required streamflow rate of 750 cubic feet per second is required past the Peachtree Creek USGS gauging station located approximately 40 miles upstream of the Whitesburg planning node. This minimum flow, established by EPD for wastewater assimilation, is incorporated in the FERC license for the Morgan Falls Dam. The license requires flow releases from Morgan Falls to conform with a "Statement of Policy issued on March 5, 2001, by Georgia Power and the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC). 7 

• 	
West Point Dam - A minimum flow of 675 cubic feet per second is required to be released below West Point Dam. 

• 	
Columbus Planning Node - A minimum flow is established at Georgia Power's North Highland Dam, located approximately 3 miles upstream of the Columbus planning node. The requirement, as stated in the FERC license for this project, provides three metrics for minimum release which must be adhered to: minimum instantaneous release of 800 cubic feet per second or basin inflow (whichever is lower), 1,350 cubic feet per second daily average release or basin inflow (whichever is lower), and 1,850 cubic feet per second 7-day average release or basin inflow (whichever is lower). 

• 	
USGS Gauge on the Apalachicola River near Chattahoochee, Florida -Seasonal RIOP flow requirements are maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers as determined by time of year, total basin inflow, and whether or not drought triggers measured by total composite federal reservoir storage are met. 


Subject to the premise of the availability of conservation storage in the federal lakes, Table 3-3 shows no apparent surface water availability gaps for the Chattahoochee River under current conditions (i.e. baseline assessment). However, impacts to other uses remain due to the inability of the current basin operating plan (RIOP) to meet instream uses.. These impacts are further described below.

Economic and Recreational Impacts. Current seasonal action zones established for West Point Lake have contributed to the loss of recreational opportunities and economic development due to issues regarding adverse impacts of prolonged low and inconsistent water levels. The initial impact level for West Point Lake, the level where it is recognized that "recreational use and safety impacts become significant at or near this level , is established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at 632.5 feet NVGD.8,9 Depending on total conservation storage in the system, current action zones require drawing down West Point Lake to at least 628 feet NVGD for flood storage beginning in November. Prolonged operation below the Corps designated impact level has resulted in job and income losses for water-dependent and recreation/tourism-based businesses, sharp declines in property values, lost recreational opportunities and declining quality of life, and lost opportunities for economic growth. 
Fish & Wildlife Conservation Impacts. Fluctuating water levels in reservoirs used for flood storage is a necessity by definition. However, further study defining long­term ecological response to this fluctuation in West Point Lake as a result of the seasonal action zones is warranted and could be used to better inform future management decisions. Preliminary research at West Point Lake concluded that "continued annual fluctuation of the water level is expected to cause further deterioration in soil composition of the exposed littoral areas, leading to lower production of benthic fish-food organisms. 10 No known update to this study has been published. Future reservoir operations should also fully consider and address impacts of reservoir operation on rare and threatened species such as the bluestripe

shiner. The bluestripe shiner, designated by the Georgia Wildlife Resources Division as rare, inhabits flowing areas in large creeks and medium-sized rivers and "tributaries whose lower reaches have been impounded by main stem reservoirs. 11 Further analysis regarding fluctuation in reservoir levels in the Chattahoochee River should be analyzed with regards to potential impacts to this species. 
The concern that research on wildlife impacts is lacking in this part of the basin and for the basin at large is echoed in comments published in the March 2010 Scoping Report for the ACF Rirer Basin which included the following: 
"Commenters stated that the Interim Operating Plan (IOP) and RIOP are "flawed" because of a lack of studies on the endangered species at West Point Lake. Some commenters said that more research needs to be conducted on endangered wildlife in the ACF Rirer Basin. EPA recommended that the Corps address and fully document the effects of any proposed actions on threatened and endangered species when considering alternatires for the EIS."12 
The health of the fisheries in West Point and Walter F. George Lakes is further dependent on the balance of nutrient availability in the form of phosphorous and nitrogen contributions from point and nonpoint sources of pollution and resulting algal productivity measured in terms of chlorophyll-a. During pre-impoundment studies, West Point Lake was anticipated to gradually become a more eutrophic (nutrient rich) water body due to cumulative nutrient loading effects caused by wastewater discharges upstream. While this impact has been mitigated to some extent via stricter NPDES permit limits set for phosphorous, the impacts associated with the relationship of nutrient concentration, algal productivity, and rapid reduction in lake levels is not well-defined and requires further study. 
Similarly, the relationships between water turbidity, water detention/velocity, water temperature, precedent weather/flow conditions, pH, growing season duration and algal growth require further study in West Point and Walter F. George lakes to establish a chlorophyll-a standard that is appropriate for these reservoirs. A chlorophyll-a standard of 25 micrograms/liter for Walter F. George Lake has been suggested as reflective of Southeastern Plains Ecoregion reservoirs. 13 
The Council, recognizing the need for a better understanding of ecological cause and response variables in the Middle Chattahoochee reservoirs to set an operating management strategy, concurs that this strategy is flawed and precautions should be taken to ensure the long-term sustainability of the reservoirs as a fishery and wildlife

The Department of Natural Resources is involved in regional restoration efforts for the shoal bass, Alabama shad, and the Gulf strain of striped bass. Shoal bass, as their name implies, inhabit large shoal areas which have become increasingly degraded by sedimentation or lost through reservoir inundation. The removal of dams near Columbus should result in greater numbers of shoal bass and new fishing opportunities. Creating ways for Alabama shad to move upstream through the lock system at Jim Woodruff Dam (Lake Seminole) has reestablished these fish in upriver areas and provided them with important habitat for spawning and rearing young. Gulf striped bass are stocked and distributed throughout the region to become an integral part of the region's sport fishery. These restoration programs are cooperative efforts between various combinations of: the states of Georgia, Florida, and Alabama, the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Geological Survey, The National Park Service, Auburn University, Georgia Power, and The Nature Conservancy. 
Critical .abitat Impacts. The Council is concerned that the minimum flow requirements designated in the RIOP below Woodruff Dam are not founded upon sound scientific justification regarding protection of threatened and endangered species. Furthermore, the context from which the Biological Opinions issued by the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to the Corps in September 2006 for the IOP and later in June of 2008 for the RIOP, sanctioned the Corps' requested operation of the system without truly addressing the underlying question of what minimum flows adequately protect threatened and endangered species. 
The Council has analyzed unimpaired, run-of-the river model data over the 68 year hydrologic period from 1939-2007 as modeled by EPD. In this model run, it was assumed that no consumptive demands or Corps operation was present in the system and it was observed that at times RIOP minimum flows would not be achieved. The probability of falling below 5,000 cubic feet per second accounted for approximately 2.8% of the time period, while the 4,500 cubic feet per second target was not met approximately 1.8% of the time. This is indicative that even without the influences of the millions of water users or Corps operation, the system would not achieve the designated RIOP minimum flow during critical drought conditions. The Council is concerned that during such times of exceptional drought, the federal storage reservoirs upstream of Woodruff Dam are being penalized for a flow requirement which would otherwise not be naturally met 100% of the time and furthermore, that operational measures in the future be rational and equitable for all users in the basin during critical low flow periods. 
Additional considerations that the Council feels that the Corps has failed to properly address or consider in determining appropriate measures for the protection of downstream critical habitat include the following: 
•	 The relationship between high flow conditions and the stranding of endangered mussel species on upper embankments of the Apalachicola River have not been adequately addressed in the Corps operating regime 
00.U_u:<  <:00u:ww_

00.U_u:<  <:00u:ww_ 

•	
 The analysis of alternative structural hydraulic measures such as temporary weirs, gates, and/or steps to control river stage and sediment transport and scour at or below Woodruff Dam in order to protect critical habitat 

•	
 The impacts on habitat associated with the impediment to store flows during the spring refill period at West Point and Walter F. George Lakes due to the stringent inflow-outflow requirements of the RIOP 


Reservoir Drought Operations Impacts. The ability of the federal reservoir projects to recover from flood storage drawdown during the spring is impeded by exceedingly stringent seasonal inflow targets established by the RIOP below which water can be held back for storage. The operation of many engineered and federally operated systems throughout the country work to refill reservoirs as soon as possible after drought conditions, whereas the Chattahoochee River inflows are required to be significantly high prior to allowing the projects to refill. This has the anticipated effect of prolonging storage deficits on the order of three or more years to replenish lakes to full pool based upon past hydrological conditions for all three of the major storage projects. 
.ydropower Impacts. The timely release of water from the federal reservoir projects allows peak power generation. The potential energy production of hydropower facilities is directly proportional to the amount of water stored in the reservoir. Therefore, a lake held at a higher level for a greater proportion of the time will have the capability to provide power supply more often. The use of the Corps operating regime for West Point Lake has adversely impacted the potential for production of hydroelectric power. 
Water .uality Impacts. While water quality standards are currently established for West Point and Walter F. George Lakes by EPD for chlorophyll a, total nitrogen, phosphorous, dissolved oxygen, and pH, the impact of those constituents as impacted by lake elevations has not been clearly defined. Sufficient and readily available water quality monitoring data from federal, state, and local governments has not been sufficiently pulled together and analyzed critically. 
Instream flows in the Chattahoochee River at the Columbus and Columbia planning nodes have been identified as areas of concern by the Council regarding flow availability for the assimilation of permitted wastewater discharges, including the discharge by the City of Columbus. Flow quantities sufficient to maintain water quality parameters are not always reliable below the Columbus and Columbia planning nodes due to current federal reservoir operations under the RIOP. For example, 17 of the 31 days from June 26th through July 29th in 2009 fell below an average daily flow rate of 1,350 cubic feet per second measured just below the Columbus Planning Node (USGS gage number 02341505). The EPD basis for assimilative capacity requirements below the Columbus Planning Node on an average daily basis is currently set at 1,150 cubic feet per second. This was not met on 9 of the 31 days over the same flow record. During such times, the streamflow may be inadequate to provide desired assimilative capacity and result in a 
_ 

degradation of water quality until such a point that operational changes are decided upon by the Corps. This type of erratic flow release pattern by the Corps and the concern regarding the available assimilative capacity in the Chattahoochee River are a primary driver for the Council's desire to set an equitable balance of flow contributions between the Chattahoochee and Flint Basins. 
Flood Control Impacts. Maintaining higher reservoir levels to achieve recreational, economic, and water quality benefits must be analyzed critically against flood protection requirements for downstream communities. While desirable benefits for higher winter pool lake level elevations have been identified, specific operating targets will need to come from further study which includes risk/benefit analysis of economic versus flood control benefits for West Point Dam. 
River Flow Impacts. In addition to Corp operations and the effects on river flow, the Council is concerned about upstream and regional consumptive use and flow returns to the river. Upstream interbasin transfers and increases in consumptive use reduce downstream flows and reduce the natural flows in the river. 
The Council encourages better stewardship through land use planning and permitting to maximize flow returns to the river. Furthermore, a more scientific understanding is needed for such uses as agricultural irrigation, wastewater land application, and septic systems in order to better quantify the water balance with truer representations of consumptive uses associated with these uses. 
Reservoir Operations and River Flow Impacts. The conflicts and inconsistencies in how federal reservoirs are operated under the current RIOP have historically impacted the instream uses as previously discussed. These issues are compounded in West Point Lake, which the Corps has heavily utilized in attempting to balance the needs and authorized purposes of the federal reservoir projects. The lack of a coherent operating regime and absence of key desired instream flow metrics has had a debilitating effect on the ability to maintain the designed balance between the authorized purposes. 
As a result, the Council has identified the need for better utilization of storage and modification of the RIOP. Storage utilization changes could account for environmental flow requirements and reevaluate the authorized purposes in the basin to account for environmental flows. A modified RIOP would provide for a more adaptive set of operational practices to accumulate flows in storage while maintaining the minimum flow required below Woodruff Dam. These gaps in the ability to meet instream uses are a challenge that the Regional Council, EPD, the Corps of Engineers, and representatives from Alabama and Florida must work toward solving. The Council is exploring options to optimize adaptive reservoir management throughout the ACF Basin to provide regional benefits for multiple stakeholders while maintaining all authorized instream uses.

3.3.2 Groundwater Availability 
The groundwater availability assessment estimated the sustainable yield for prioritized groundwater resources based on existing data. Groundwater modeling was not performed for the entire Middle Chattahoochee region. EPD prioritized the aquifers modeled based on the characteristics of the aquifer, evidence of negative effects, anticipated negative impacts, and other considerations. 
The groundwater resource assessments identified the sustainable yield, or the volume of groundwater that can be used without negative impacts. Negative impacts included limiting use of neighboring wells (drawdown), reducing groundwater contributions to stream baseflows, and the permanent reduction of groundwater levels. Only one of the prioritized aquifer areas modeled fell within the region. The Claiborne aquifer, which delineated an area in southwestern Georgia, included portions of Clay, .uitman, and Randolph counties. The Middle Chattahoochee water planning region must coordinate usage of this aquifer formation with other water planning regions, particularly the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee and Upper Flint, to ensure the sustainable yield for this groundwater source is maintained. 
The sustainable yield estimates for the Claiborne aquifer were determined using numerical flow model simulation with various combinations of withdrawals from existing wells and, where applicable, from simulated new wells. Results of the simulations indicated a range of sustainable yields for this prioritized aquifer as shown in Table 3-4.

The withdrawal of groundwater in some areas of the Coastal Plain exceeds the sustainable yield. The impacts of groundwater on surface water flows in the Flint River and its tributaries are known and represented in the surface water availability model results for the Bainbridge planning node presented in Table 3-2. During times of drought, groundwater pumpage in the Flint Basin increases for agricultural irrigation purposes. This in turn reduces the available Flint River flow contribution to Lake Seminole, which ultimately is made up from storage on the Chattahoochee River. The Middle Chattahoochee Council has and will continue to facilitate interregional coordination efforts with the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee and Upper Flint planning regions in finding solutions to alleviate this gap. This must include coordination in the continued use of groundwater resources in the region. For areas that rely on sustainable groundwater yields, a detailed well-field analysis may be required.

3.3.3 Surface Water .uality {Assimilative Capacity) 
The assimilative capacity assessment estimates the capacity of Georgia's surface waters to naturally reduce pollutant levels without unacceptable degradation of water quality. The term assimilative capacity refers to the ability of a water body to naturally reduce pollutants to a level that does not exceed state water quality standards or harm aquatic life. 
Two water quality model evaluations were developed to show the current status of the available assimilative capacity based on current discharges: 
1. 
River Model (Dissolved Oxygen Modeling) -This model evaluates dissolved oxygen due to existing point discharges under critical conditions. 

2.
 Lake and Watershed Models (Nutrient Modeling) -These models evaluate the impacts of point and nonpoint sources from nutrient loadings. Nutrients modeled included nitrogen and phosphorus. For lakes chlorophyll-a was modeled (a green pigment found in algae; the concentration of chlorophyll-a is one parameter used to assess lake water quality). The watershed and lake models account for nutrient sources from both wastewater discharges and nonpoint source stormwater runoff based on various land uses. 


The water quality assessment models are not the same as the 303(d) list of impaired waters (see section 3.4.1) or total maximum daily loads, because this assessment is only looking at dissolved oxygen and nutrients; the 303(d) list includes stream reaches listed as impaired on the basis of dissolved oxygen and other parameters such as metals, bacteria, and biota. Furthermore, the 303(d) list is based on analytical results from stream monitoring and not model results. 
Determining assimilative capacity is dependent on different parameters and requires information on the stream flow, in-stream water quality, wastewater discharges, water withdrawals, existence of land application systems, weather information, land use, stream hydrology, topography, and the state's water quality standards. 
Dissolved O. ygen Modeling Figures 3-5 and 3-6 shows the in-stream dissolved oxygen model results with existing discharges during critical low flow, high temperature conditions. Stream segments where available assimilative capacity is exceeded are red; segments that have no available assimilative capacity under critical low flow (7.10) and high temperature conditions are pink. Those with DO levels well in excess of state water quality standards are blue.

3.-. Ecosystem Conditions  
In order to better protect the health of aquatic ecosystems and to conserve water for downstream users, Georgia EPD established an interim minimum instream flow policy, effective April 1, 2001. All new applications for new or expanded surface water withdrawals are required to demonstrate that instream uses will be protected by one of the following means: an established monthly 7.10 minimum flow, a site­specific flow study from which seasonal instream flows would be derived, or a percentage of the mean annual flow based on whether the source is a reservoir or a water withdrawal. 
The Georgia Comprehensive State-wide Water Management Plan states that "so long as water permit holders (i.e. withdrawal and/or discharge) are in compliance with permit conditions that require conformance with Georgia's water quality standards, with the Board of Natural Resources May 2001 instream flow protection strategy (or superseding instream flow policy adopted by the Board of Natural Resources), and with other permit conditions as set by the EPD Director, activities covered under the water permits will be considered to be consistent with protection of natural systems and biological integrity of the water resources to which the permits apply . 
3.-. 3.3{d) list and iMDLs The state of Georgia assesses water bodies for compliance with water quality standards, as required by the Federal Clean Water Act (CWA). Waters of the state are monitored by EPD, USGS, and other local authorities contracted by EPD. If an assessed water body is found not to meet standards, then it is considered "not supporting its designated use(s) and is included on a list of impaired waters. Impairments must be addressed through the development of a Total Maximum Daily Load, which sets a pollutant load and outlines a strategy for corrective action. Several stream reaches in the Middle Chattahoochee region are on the state's list of impaired waters and are illustrated and summarized in Figure 3-7. An expanded discussion on water use classification and a full list of impaired waters in the region 
_ 

is provided in the Existing Regulatory and Local Plan Summary supplemental document available on the Middle Chattahoochee website. 14 
3.-.2 Conservation Resources 
Protection of rare plants and animals in the ACF Basin is of critical importance to the Middle Chattahoochee Region as witnessed in Phase 2 of the Multi-District Litigation. The Federal Court upheld the U.S. Fish and Wildlife's Biological Opinions in 2006 and 2008 to the Army Corps of Engineers, establishing water flows and water elevations which were opined to adequately protect the gulf sturgeon and two species of endangered mussel. The Council and the EPD must continue to be engaged in the development of further scientific studies which better define the water quantity and water quality conditions which best support ecological health, as such results have proven to impact stakeholders throughout the basin. Critical information needs to be gathered to determine how and what species are impacted by water flow, water quality, and lake elevations in the ACF. 
Georgia's Wildlife Resources Division (WRD) developed a comprehensive wildlife conservation strategy "to conserve Georgia's animals, plants, and natural habitats through proactive measures emphasizing voluntary and incentive-based programs on private lands, habitat restoration and management by public agencies and private conservation organizations, rare species survey and recovery efforts, and environmental education and public outreach activities. Results were published on 
August 31, 2005 in A Comprehensire Wildlife Conserration Strategy for Georgia. 
High priority species and habitats were identified and summarized at the ecoregion level, with a total of five ecoregions being designated for the state. Portions of the Middle Chattahoochee water planning region fall within the southeastern plains ecoregion with the remainder in the piedmont. A total of 85 high priority animal species, 145 high priority plants species, and 27 high priority habitat types were identified for the southeastern plains ecoregion. A total of 55 high priority animal species, 71 high priority plants species, and 16 high priority habitat types were identified for the piedmont ecoregion. Further qualification of the high priority species needs to be performed to begin to better understand the impacts of water quantity, water quality, and lake elevations on those species. A summary of aquatic species which are currently under state or federal protection and a list of high priority waters specific to the Middle Chattahoochee region are included in the Existing Regulatory and Local Plan Review supplemental document available on the Council website. 15

4. FORECASTING FUTURE WATER RESOURCE NEEDS 
[This Page Intentionally Left Blank] 

Section 4. Forecasting Future Water Resource Needs 
Water and wastewater demand forecasts, along with the resource assessments (Section 3), form the foundation for water planning in the Middle Chattahoochee Region and serve as the basis for the selection of water management practices (Section 6). The tables and graphics in this section present the regional water and wastewater forecasts for 10-year intervals from 2010 through 2050 for four water use sectors: municipal, industrial, agriculture, and thermoelectric generation. 
During development of this plan, EPD requested water use forecasts for the four use sectors from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). Because of the current tri-state litigation, ADEM did not provide forecasts, only current day demands were provided.  The Middle Chattahoochee Council directly appealed to ADEM requesting this data as well and had not received a response as of the writing of this plan. 
4.1 Municipal Forecasts 
The residential and commercial water demand and demands of small (non-major water using) industries were projected as one combined category and referred to as the municipal demand.  Demands for major water using industries were projected separately and are discussed in Section 4.2. 
Population Projections 
Municipal water and wastewater forecasts are closely tied to the population projections for the counties within the Middle Chattahoochee Region.  The population projections were developed by the Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget (OPB) for the entire state.  The OPB is charged in state law (O.C.G.A. 45-12-171) with the responsibility for preparing, maintaining, and furnishing official demographic data for the state. The population projection results by county are shown in Table 4-1.

Municipal Water Forecasts 
The municipal water forecasts were calculated by multiplying the per capita water use by the population served.  As the per capita water use is different for public water systems and those served by self-supply (private wells), the demands are calculated separately and then summed together. For publicly-supplied water use, a baseline per capita water use rate, on an annual average daily basis was determined for each county and applied to the projected population to obtain the projected future municipal water demand. This baseline per capita water use rate was calculated and refined to ensure that it was representative of the actual water use of the county. Adjustments of the baseline per capita water use rate were made based on input from water suppliers, council members, and from historical survey data as provided by EPD. 
Further adjustments to the per capita rate were made based upon Georgia state code, Title 8, Section 8-2-3 which states that after April 1, 1992, all residential buildings of all types shall not be constructed with a toilet that uses more than 1.6 gallons of water per flush.  After the initial round of forecasting had been completed the Water Stewardship Act was passed by the Georgia General Assembly further reducing the volumetric flush rates of toilets to 1.28 gallons per flush effective after July 1, 2012. The methodology used to determine the water savings associated with toilet replacements and overall municipal and industrial forecasting is further discussed in the Municipal and Industrial Water and Wastewater Forecasting Memorandum provided as a supplemental document available on the Middle Chattahoochee website.1 A Water Conservation Technical Memorandum is also provided on the website, which quantifies the water savings associated with high efficiency flush toilets. 
The municipal water forecasts are shown in Figure 4-1.

4. Forecasting Future WaterResource Needs 
Municipal Wastewater Forecasts 
Municipal wastewater forecasts were calculated by multiplying the municipal water use by a factor to estimate indoor water use, because outdoor water use does not require wastewater treatment. Indoor water use may be treated by one of three disposal systems; municipal wastewater treatment plant to point source discharge, municipal wastewater treatment to land application system, or an onsite sanitary sewage management system (OSSMS), also called septic systems. 
Subtracting the flow to OSSMS from the total indoor water use provides the estimated flow to a municipal wastewater treatment plant.  The wastewater flows to the municipal wastewater treatment plants are increased to account for inflow and infiltration (I/I).  I/I is a term used to describe groundwater and stormwater that enters into the dedicated wastewater system. Figure 4-1 shows the municipal wastewater flows over the planning period.  Forecasts were performed for state of Georgia based demands only. The current Alabama based consumptive demands as presented in Section 3 were held constant through the planning horizon.

4.2 Industrial Forecasts 
Industrial water and wastewater demand forecasts anticipate the future needs for the industries that are expected to be the major water users through 2050.  Industries require water for use in their production processes, sanitation, cooling, as well as employee use and consumption.  The forecasts presented in this section are based upon either the rate of growth in employment for specific industrial sectors, the rate of growth in the units of production for specific industrial sectors, or other credible and relevant information and data provided by specific industrial water users. Forecasts were performed for state of Georgia based demands only. The current

Alabama based consumptive demands as presented in Section 3 were held constant through the planning horizon. 
Employment Projections 
The employment projections provided information on the anticipated employment growth rate for each industrial sector.  The University of Georgia produced the industry-specific rates of growth for employment for EPD, which were used to calculate the future water needs for specific industries within the water planning region. The current industrial water use volume within a particular basin or aquifer unit was assumed to grow in direct proportion to the projected growth in regional industrial employment for the major water using industries. Water use for any industry with a projected decline in employment remained at the level of water use before the employment begins to decline. The assumption is that industrial water needs may not remain tied to employment in the future and a decline in employment may not reflect a decrease in water use for the industry. Furthermore, for regional planning purposes, the regions should plan to retain current water use levels and plan for growth. In the Middle Chattahoochee Region overall employment from major industrial water using industries is anticipated to increase by 45% over the 2010­2050 planning horizon. 

Industrial Water Forecasts 
Industrial water forecasts were calculated using information and data specific to each of the major water using industries.  For industries where information was available on water use per unit of production, water forecasts were based on production.  For industries where product based forecasts were not possible, industry-specific workforce projections were assumed to reflect the anticipated growth in water use within the industry. Figure 4-2 shows the industrial water demands over the planning period. 

Industrial Wastewater Forecasts 
Industrial wastewater forecasts were calculated for each sector by multiplying the industrial water forecast by the ratio of wastewater generated to water used for that industrial sector. The primary mechanism for deriving the wastewater to water ratios was through a state-wide analysis of multiple years of actual annual average water return and withdrawal data for permitted users. Default ratios were then averaged by industry type and applied to the forecasted water volumes to generate a wastewater forecast. Ratios specific for the region and/or defensible and credible input provided by industrial stakeholder groups were used in lieu of the default ratios where available. 
Figure 4-2 shows the industrial water and wastewater demands over the planning period.

4.3 Agricultural Forecasts 
Agricultural water use includes both crop production and non-crop agricultural (livestock, nurseries, golf courses, etc.) water use.  The crop forecasts, developed by the University of Georgia, provide a range of irrigation water use under dry, medium and wet climate conditions based on the acres irrigated for each crop.  In collaboration with industry stakeholders, the University of Georgia also forecasted water use for the green industry (in-ground, container and low input nurseries and greenhouse operations). Normal and dry climate conditions were estimated for existing permitted golf courses through a collaborative analysis by EPD and the Georgia Golf Course Superintendents Association. For planning purposes, current dry year estimates were held constant through the planning horizon for golf courses. 
The agricultural water demands for non-permitted agricultural uses, such as livestock production, were estimated for current conditions for EPD through a collaborative effort led by the University of Georgia and Albany State University.  The livestock estimates represent the water used to raise livestock, not including processing facilities. The non-permitted agricultural use information reflects strong coordination between EPD and these water users. Projected water use forecasts for livestock agricultural use were not developed for this effort due to lack of available data. Furthermore, data did not include geographic or water source information and thus could not be utilized in EPDs resource assessment modeling. The livestock use was therefore not included in the aggregate dry year agricultural forecasts for resource assessment purposes. The agricultural demand for the planning period is shown in Table 4-2.

Agricultural water use in the Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Region represents 4% of the total agricultural use in the ACF Basin by 2050 (not including Alabama demands).  The largest agricultural use through the planning horizon occurs in the lower Flint River Basin. Heavy utilization of the surface water and groundwater resources in the lower Flint River impacts the flow quantities available to meet the seasonal RIOP targets below Woodruff Dam. The release of reservoir storage in the Chattahoochee Basin is utilized at times to offset lower flow from the Flint River Basin. 
4.4 Water for Thermoelectric Power Forecasts 
The use of the Chattahoochee River by thermoelectric power producers is significant. State energy projections show needs for more energy and as a consequence, more water. The additional power plant capacity has not been geographically determined; therefore, lacking this information, the Middle Chattahoochee region shows no increase in water consumption for thermoelectric power requirements for the planning period. 
Several large Southern Company facilities are located along the Chattahoochee River and permitted by EPD including Plant McDonough, Plant Yates, Plant Wansley, and Plant Franklin (located in Alabama).  A fifth Southern Company plant, Plant Farley also represents a significant water use in the system. The Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant, located near Dothan in southeast Alabama, is owned by 
MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE 



4. Forecasting Future WaterResource Needs 
Alabama Power and operated by Southern Nuclear Operating Company. The plant is located in Alabama, upstream of the Woodruff Dam planning node and permitted by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. One additional thermoelectric plant is currently proposed for construction in Early County, Georgia. The project, a 1,200 MW coal facility, has been proposed by Longleaf Energy Associates, a subsidiary of LS Power Development. 
Several smaller biomass plants are also proposed in the ACF region. An example is the Yellow Pine Energy Company, LLC, a biomass-fired facility to be located near Fort Gaines, Georgia2. The Yellow Pine facility was scheduled to go into operation in 2010 and will produce 110 megawatts of renewable energy using wood product waste material. 
The 2005 total annual average consumptive demand for the large thermoelectric facilities located on the Chattahoochee River was approximately 75 million gallons per day (Table 4-3). This demand was included in EPD’s surface water availability model for the Chattahoochee River Basin component of the ACF Basin model. The current consumptive use of 38 million gallons per day for Plants Yates and Wansley (95 million gallons per day combined withdrawal minus 57 million gallons per day combined return) represents the geographically located thermoelectric water use in the Middle Chattahoochee region (Figure 4-3 and 4-4). 
The Georgia EPD assembled an energy water use task force to provide input on energy water use forecasts for the state.  The “Alternative” condition forecast, which represents an upper end estimate for the state, shows an increase in annual energy needs to approximately 330,000 gigawatt hours in 2050. These forecasts indicate that the estimated energy needs for the state will exceed existing and planned3 power production; therefore, additional power production facilities are needed4 . Given appropriate transmission infrastructure improvements, these additional power needs could be met by producing energy anywhere in the state (although these needs would preferably be located as near as possible to demand centers); therefore, while the amount of water needed to produce the forecasted electrical needs was calculated, this water need was not geographically determined. 
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Council recognizes that the region is projected to grow and that growth will put pressure on all of our state’s resources, including water and electricity. Therefore, the Council encourages the use of best management practices for cooling and water use, recommends that energy providers should continue to work with EPD in pursuing the goals of Chapter 3, Conserving Water

Used for Electric Generation and Use of the State’s Water Conservation and Implementation Plan, and recommends that EPD review withdrawal and discharge permits for additional facilities in the region considering the limitations of the region’s water resources to prevent exacerbation of instream water use impacts as discussed in Section 3 of this Regional Water Plan.

Consumptive water demand estimates for Plant Farley were provided to EPD from the Corps of Engineers. This value (36.4 MGD) represents the estimated consumptive Alabama demand for the Woodruff Planning Node as provided to the Council. 4. After conversion from coal fired to gas fired units in 2012, Plant McDonough’s generating capacity will increase from 568 MW to 2,520 MW. 5. The zero ( 0 ) MGD estimated consumptive water demand for Plant McDonough reflects the use of once­through cooling employed by that facility for the representative year analyzed for this plan. The addition of cooling towers to this plant will need to be reflected in the water availability resource assessments during the five year update to this plan. 6. Plant Yates is physically located in Coweta County in the Metro North Georgia Water Planning District; however, since the plant intake and discharge is south of the Whitesburg planning node, this plant is listed with Middle Chattahoochee uses.

4.5 Total Water Demand Forecasts 
Municipal water use makes up the largest proportion of regional water use. As shown in Figures 4-3 through 4-5, this trend is expected to continue through the planning horizon and become more prominent as residential/commercial development continues to grow.  The increase in water use will also result in increased wastewater generation and disposal needs. As the quantity of wastewater discharged to 
September 2011 

receiving waters increases, the level of treatment will also need to increase where TMDLs are identified to be reached or exceeded. Additional consideration needs to be taken regarding current operation of the ACF Basin by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the ability to meet the future consumptive demands presented in this section and the instream uses and congressionally authorized purposes presented in Sections 2 and 3.

The Council advocates for an adaptive reservoir management strategy to better meet all existing instream flow and water supply requirements while benefitting multiple stakeholders throughout the basin. One such strategy presented by Dr. Aris Georgakakos of the Georgia Tech Georgia Water Resources Institute and endorsed by the Council is provided as a supplemental document available on the Middle Chattahoochee website.5 
The total water demand for the ACF Basin must be coordinated through continued collaboration between the Council with the Metro North District, Lower Flint-Ochlockonee, and Upper Flint Councils, to present and implement management practices that represent fair and equitable allocations of the limited resources. Furthermore, the councils will need the State’s support in implementing these management practices and coordinating interstate resource issues. Of primary importance to the council are those issues relating to changes in the management of federal reservoirs, the impacts of groundwater pumpage on groundwater contributions to Flint River baseflow and potential impacts on Chattahoochee storage to make up RIOP flow requirements below Woodruff Dam, and the scientific justification of the flows required by the RIOP.

5. 	COMPARISON OF WATER RESOUCE CAPACITIES AND FUTURE NEEDS 
[This Page Intentionally Left Blank] 

Section 5.  Comparison of Water Resource Capacities and Future Needs 
This Section compares the water and wastewater demand forecasts (Section 4), along with the resource assessments (Section 3), providing the basis for selecting water management practices (Section 6).  Areas where the future withdrawal or waste assimilation exceed the capacity of the resource for groundwater, surface water availability and surface water quality (assimilative capacity) will be addressed through water management practices. Areas where instream uses are not satisfied are also discussed.  
5.1. Surface Water Availability Comparisons 
Projected conditions in 2050 are similar to the current conditions described in Section 3. Significant gaps are identified under future 2050 demand conditions at the Heflin and Newell planning nodes in the Tallapoosa Basin. At the Montezuma planning node, no significant flow gap was identified under 2050 demand conditions. Downstream, at the Bainbridge node, a substantial gap was identified, both under current and future conditions. For the Bainbridge node, the gap is affected both by consumptive use of surface water and by the withdrawals from the Floridan Aquifer in subarea 4 of the Dougherty Plain, where interconnection between the groundwater and surface water system is high. The average shortfall in the Flint River is modeled to increase by less than one percent by 2050. No observed shortfalls are noted for the Chattahoochee River; however, any future demand met in the model by use of existing storage should be considered a potential surface water availability gap and addressed through management practices. Furthermore, the conclusion of no shortfall along the Chattahoochee River is on the basis that the current Revised Interim Operations Plan (RIOP) remains unchanged and conservation storage is available to fulfill demands. As discussed in Section 3, the Council takes exception to the manner in which the Corps has operated the system under the RIOP and identified impacts associated with the RIOP, including the following: 
•
 Economic and Recreational Impacts 

•
 Fish & Wildlife Conservation Impacts 

•
 Critical Habitat Impacts 

•
 Reservoir Drought Operation Impacts 

•
 Hydropower Impacts

A projected increase in surface water consumption of approximately 31 million gallons per day on an annual average basis is anticipated for the region. The results of the future surface water availability model are illustrated in Figure 5-1. 
As a result of these impacts, the Council has identified the need for an improved operating plan for the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) Basin which equitably balances the multiple authorized purposes of the federally operated reservoirs and addresses impacts on instream uses throughout the basin. The Council has identified a range of desired outcomes to be accomplished through modification of the existing Corp's RIOP. This desired state aims to equitably balance reservoir storage in the basin and meet instream needs. Major goals of such a desired state include the following: 
• 	
Reduce operational winter drawdown of West Point Lake. Council members have stated that they desire that West Point Lake be operated to maintain levels above the prescribed impact level of 632.5 feet NVGD as often as possible provided that adequate winter drawdown is maintained to provide for flood storage. Council members believe that induced flood storage for flood control between elevations of 635-641 feet NVGD should be examined and, if found to be acceptable by the Corps, used as routine flood storage. 

•	
 Establish and maintain instream flow guidelines below the Columbus and Columbia planning nodes to ensure adequate protection of water quality for downstream users. The Corp's RIOP does not recognize any flow targets in the vicinity of the Columbus planning node.1 The Council recommends that a starting point to establishing flow guidelines would be to acknowledge the FERC permit flow guidelines in the permits for upstream reservoirs. 

• 	
Allow for operational flexibility to enable storage reservoirs to recover faster after severe droughts and thus reduce the risk of follow-up droughts for all ACF stakeholders. 

•	
 Ensure critical habitat for federally and state protected species are managed in accordance with state and federal policy requirements. Ensure that requirements aimed at doing so are founded upon thorough and accepted science by all stakeholders for the range of species and habitats throughout the basin. 


As a historical note, in almost all of the Corps' and EPD's ACF Basin models for assessing current operations, a flow target of 1200 cfs has been used in the vicinity of the Columbus planning node. This number is greater than 98% exceedance levels of the observed flow (1939-2007) at this location2. Since 1976, when West Point Lake was 
1 The only control points in the entire ACF Basin, according to the Corps, are a 750 cfs flow requirement at Peachtree Creek confluence with the Chattahoochee River and a flow requirement at Chattahoochee, Florida per the Revised Interim Operation Plan.

September 2011 

placed in operation, the observed Columbus flow has exceeded 1200 cfs 99.2% of the time. In other words, modeling of this flow target does not deviate much from the Corp's actual historic operation. It is the Council's contention that water quality would be enhanced if these flow guidelines were recognized by inclusion in the RIOP. 
The Council recognizes that specific operating targets should come from more detailed modeling and analysis; however, modeling which has already been performed illustrates the possibility of achieving the above listed goals and meets future demands. One model, produced by Dr. Georgakakos of the Georgia Institute of Technology's Georgia Water Resources Institute, shows that simple modifications to the RIOP could meet instream flow and future water supply requirements, result in higher Lake Lanier and West Point Lake levels during droughts, meet planning level flow targets below the Columbus and Columbia planning nodes, and aid in more rapid recovery of reservoir levels after severe drought conditions. Furthermore, the model constrained flows below Woodruff Dam to achieve a minimum flow of 5,000 cubic feet per second. Resulting flow distributions below Woodruff Dam would not be appreciably different than what currently occurs under the RIOP. Despite this insight, the Council still recognizes a need for further scientific evaluation regarding the protection of critical habitats. 
EPD resource assessment modelers have confirmed that the model produced by Dr. Georgakakos is similar to the modeling tools utilized by EPD and that with the same constraints and modeling inputs the two models would produce very similar results. The model results as presented to the Council are provided as a supplemental document on the Middle Chattahoochee website3 and model targets and constraints summarized in Table 5-1.

The Council endorses the conditions in the modeling work performed by Dr. Georgakakos for further development and encourages discussion between EPD, regional councils, the Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and stakeholders in the tri-state area regarding the advantages of this approach and further refinement andanalysis which could be required. 

5.2. Groundwater Availability Comparisons 
Section 3.2.2. discussedthe groundwater resource sustainable yields and current use of assessed aquifers. A comparison of sustainable yields and forecasted 2050 demands from those aquifers is included in Figure 5-2 for the Claiborne aquifer. The results indicate that in the Claiborne, forecasted 2050 use will be within the sustainable yield range forthis aquifer. 
The low end estimate for the sustainable yield was determined by uniformly increasing withdrawals from existing modeled wells. The high end sustainable yield was calculated by distributing the forecasted groundwater demand over the entire prioritized aquifer. The forecasted demandis higherthan the low sustainable yield but lowerthan the upper sustainable yield. Management practice selection (Section 7) will work toward mitigating this andothergaps identifiedin the resource assessments.

5.3. Surface Water Quality Comparisons Assimilative Capacity 
Dissolved oxygen modeling (DOSAG) has been performed using future 2050 flow at permitted load limits for existing NPDES permit holders and should provide a reasonable approximation of future conditions for most of the council. DOSAG modeling results are presented in Figures 5-3 and 5-4 and indicate that approximately 31 of the 603 Chattahoochee River miles modeled (five percent) will have exceeded their assimilative capacities for dissolved oxygen. All 31 miles of streams modeled as at or above the assimilative capacity limit are located on the mainstem of the Chattahoochee River beginning in central Douglas/Fulton counties in the Metro North Georgia District and terminating where backwater effects from West Point Lake occur in Heard County. 
Watershed and lake modeling indicate that future increases in nutrient loads to the Lake Lanier, Chattahoochee, and Flint watersheds are primarily due to the projected increase in point source discharges and secondarily due to changes in land use and nonpoint runoff. The modeled trends for nutrient loads over the planning horizon for the Chattahoochee watershed are illustrated in Figure 5-5. Modeled chlorophyll-a levels were compared with existing chlorophyll-a standards for the major reservoirs along the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers. The models resulted in the following:

6. ADDRESSING WATER NEEDS AND REGIONAL GOALS 
[This Page Intentionally Left Blank] 

Section 6. Addressing Water Needs and Regional Goals 
6.1 Identifying Water Management Practices 
The comparison of resource assessments and forecasted needs presented in Section 5 identifies the Middle Chattahoochee Region's likely resource gaps and demonstrates the need for water management practices. In the Chattahoochee River Basin, where council-defined gaps are present for instream uses and use of existing storage, the management practices in this section have been selected to also meet those needs. In selecting the actions needed, the Council considered practices identified in existing plans, as well as the Council's vision and goals, and coordination with local governments, water providers, and neighboring councils that share these water resources.  The Council identified several uncertainties that could impact plan implementation, including:   
•
 Revision of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers water control manual for the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) basin  

•
 Consultation regarding the 2008 Biological Opinion provided to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been reinitiated pursuant to provisions of the Endangered Species Act as of September 20, 2010. The consultation will continue ongoing depth distribution data collection and analysis to determine if the minimum flow of 5,000 cubic feet per second required under the RIOP needs to be increased in order to protect listed species 

•
 EPA promulgation of final nutrient criteria for Florida's lakes and flowing waters and resulting requirements for Georgia permittees 

•
 Potential state regulatory changes (e.g., revisions to the state dissolved oxygen standard) 

•
 Information needs to address water quality data gaps for water bodies in the region 

•
 Information needs regarding impacts of identified gaps between resource capacities and demands 

•
 Information needs regarding baseline best management practices implementation in the region 

•
 Alabama forecasted demands 


. 00.U u:<..<:00u:ww 

 
September 2011 
 
 

•	 Coordination needs with other councils, particularly the Upper Flint, Lower Flint-Ochlockonee, and the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District 
Despite these uncertainties, the Council proceeded with plan development based on the best information currently available. The Council recognizes that, per the State­wide Water Plan, the Regional Water Plan will be reviewed and revised every five years, allowing the Council to adapt the plan to any resolution and/or increased knowledge of the uncertainties identified. 
6.1.1 Review of Existing Plans and Practices The Middle Chattahoochee Regional Water Planning Council conducted a comprehensive review of existing local and regional water management plans and relevant related documents to frame the selection of management practices. When possible, successful management practices already planned for and/or in use in the region formed the basis for the water management practices selected by the Council. In addition, recommended actions were selected so as not to conflict with other existing state or regional plans. A summary of the local and regional plans reviewed 
is provided as the Existing Regulatory and Local Plan Summary supplemental document on the Middle Chattahoochee website.1 

6.2 Selected Water Management Practices for the Middle Chattahoochee Region 
The management practices selected by the Council are summarized in Table 6-1 and categorized into water quantity, instream use, and water quality management practices. The Council selected the water quantity and water quality management practices to apply to the whole Middle Chattahoochee water planning region. Although the region's boundaries cross multiple surface water and groundwater resources, the Council believes that the management practices will be beneficial to all of these resources and that within the region, issues across different water resources are similar enough that the selected practices are appropriate to be applied across the whole region. 
A discussion of the management practices follows the table. Further details regarding the process of management practice selection are provided in the Management Practice Selection Technical Memorandum supplemental document on the Middle Chattahoochee website.1

The above savings estimate was revised based upon the requirements of the Water Stewardship Act  Through the 40 year panning horizon, the revised reduction in water usage has been estimated for toi et rep acements as fo ows: 
• 	Water withdrawa savings of nine (9) mi ion ga  ons per day and four (4) mi ion ga ons per day consumption reduction due to recent (Water Stewardship Act) toi et conservation egis ation 
Additiona water savings wi be rea ized through continued water conservation practices a ready in p ace and other Tier 1 and 2 practices The rea ization of these savings wi be ref ected in regiona per capita water use rates over time Other practices which cou d reduce per capita water demand are enhanced pubic education programs and deve opment and imp ementation of water conservation rate structures  The Counci considers the continued monitoring of the per capita water use rate as a key indicator to measure the effectiveness of such conservation measures 
In the absence of base ine imp ementation data, the abi ity to generate meaningfu resu ts regarding water savings is not rea istic at this time A consistent and sound method for co  ecting and ana yzing data for existing conservation practices is needed to produce meaningfu estimates of water savings as we as cost-benefit ana yses  Future tracking of conservation measures for water savings wou d be beneficia ; however,  oca governments and municipa authorities ack the resources avai ab e to deve op and imp ement such tracking programs State-wide initiatives, direction, and future guidance coud hep overcome these cha enges Continued dia ogue between a  major water using sectors (agricuture, energy, industria , and municipa) is a so needed to deve op and obtain this type of base ine

These amounts account on y for the voume needed to offset the f ow shortfa   It does not inc ude other voumes that woud be necessary or that might be added to provide for additiona  purposes (e g , recreation) For exampe, this amount does not incude voume needed to offset evaporation, seepage, and does not inc ude a .dead poo. According to the mode resu ts, in 200., a reservoir of 162,223 acre-feet wou d have been emptied comp ete y at the Bainbridge node  Furthermore, it wou d not have comp ete y offset the mode ed f ow shortfa  because of evaporation and seepage osses  Therefore, this estimate is not a design estimate for a reservoir It does, however, indicate that a reservoir of significant size woud be needed to c ose the Bainbridge gap The Counci recognizes that the identified regiona and interregiona gaps identified need further examination with regards to instream f ow protection and environmenta impacts and furthermore that construction of arge­sca e storage wou d require further evauation to quantify environmenta impacts and cost-effectiveness 
Further data co  ection and/or ana ysis needs have a so been identified for severa water supp y management practices, inc uding better quantification of: 
•	
 Farm ponds -.ow wou d farm ponds affect surface water avai abi ity and how can they be incorporated into surface water avai abi ity mode ing? It shoud be noted that farm ponds are intended to be used as an a ternative agricutura irrigation source during drought periods, not for f ow augmentation A study to ana yze appropriate rep enishment of water storage in new farm ponds is recommended to ensure that surface water avai abi ity gaps during ow f ow drought conditions are not exacerbated and that mode resu ts correct y ref ect usage 

• 	
Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) -.ow wou d the use of aquifer storage and recovery hep a eviate gaps in the mode ed area of the Caiborne aquifer in the southern portion of the region?  The source of surface water suppies, costs of treatment, we s, and operation and resu ting cost-benefit need further definition in order to deve op the effectiveness and app icabi ity of this practice for the region 


Additiona practices inc uding encouraging interconnection of regiona suppy systems and encouraging preparation of oca drought contingency p ans ref ect too s to aid in the more efficient use of water resources in the region These too s are wide ranging and do not end themseves to exp icit quantification in terms of their abi ity to mitigate against resource avai abi ity gaps in the Ta apoosa and/or Caiborne aquifers They do, however, add to the portfo io of management practices, which wi make progress toward c osing identified gaps 

. Addressing Water Needs and Regional Goals 
The Counci recognizes that the quantity and ocation of future wastewater discharges wi need to be reevauated in the future as better water qua ity data and mode ing scenarios become more we -defined Dischargers wi be affected by pending regu ations pertaining to the estabishment of more stringent protective
 eve s for nutrients and other constituents in the waters within the region and the state and as existing TMDL  imits are reached enhanced treatment wi be required 
.... Instream .se Management Practices The instream use management practices are targeted primari y to engage regiona stakeho ders, EPD, and the US Army Corps of Engineers to further consider the counci defined gaps and the inabi ity of the Revised Interim Operations Pan (RIOP) to meet instream uses for the ACF Basin as described in Section 3  These identified gaps and the management practices identified herein form the basis for the Counci's recommendations to the state as presented in Section . 4 
.... Water ..ality Management Practices Water qua ity is an extreme y important consideration to stakeho ders in the Midd e Chattahoochee region to meeting the vision and goa s defined by the Counci  The Counci advocates for identifying and securing adequate funding sources to continue and expand existing nonpoint source management programs The Counci does not however, condone nor advocate future egis ation to address regiona or statewide water qua ity issues that are unfunded or otherwise p ace economic burdens on oca governments or uti ities to direct y fund such initiatives  Even with the work that has been done in the state and the region, significant data, information, and funding needs to provide for future refinement of management practices and improved regiona water qua ity remain   These inc ude: 
• 	
Additiona water qua ity data for water bodies in the region to continua y refine and reca ibrate current water qua ity mode s, increased monitoring and oversight of C ean Water Act 303(d)  isted stream segments, and improved presentation and access of existing and future water qua ity data from mu tip e state and federa agencies to regiona stakeho ders and the genera pubic

7. IMPLEMENTING WATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 
[This Page Intentionally Left Blank] 

Section 7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
This section presents the Middle Chattahoochee Council's roadmap for the implementation of the water management practices identified in Section 6.  Schedules for implementation, in addition to the early step(s) required to initiate implementation of a given practice, are presented for both short- and long-term actions. The Middle Chattahoochee Council has defined short-term as those practices which can be implemented prior to the five year update period envisioned in the planning process. Long-term management practices are those which require time beyond the five year planning period, vary in size and scope, and need further refinement.  As the State Water Plan provides, this plan will be primarily implemented by the various water users in the region, therefore the Middle Chattahoochee Council has described the roles and responsibilities of the implementing parties as well as the fiscal implications of the practices.   
7.1 Implementation Schedule and Roles of Responsible Parties 
Table 7-1 ties the resource shortfalls and the needs specified by the Council and the corresponding management practices detailed in Table 6-1 to the parties who will implement those practices. This table also describes the timeframe for implementation and the specific steps required for implementation. The Council has deemed those management practices where EPD or other state agencies are identified as responsible parties, to support the regional vision and goals and assist in the mitigation of gaps identified in the resource assessments (Tallapoosa River Basin Planning Nodes and Claiborne aquifer). They can also help the Council and the state to define future conditions and operations of the federal reservoir system in the Chattahoochee River Basin that are fair and equitable to all users and protective of instream uses.

7.2 iscal Implications of Selected Water Management Practices 
The availability of funding and time are critical determinants in successful implementation of management practices. Sources of funding for programs and studies identified in the selected management practices could come directly from revenues generated by water/wastewater providers, local government general funds raised through property taxes, or service fees charged by local governments to citizens. Alternatively, water providers and individuals can apply for loans and/or grants to finance capital improvement practices or programs. Affected authorities and individuals in the region will be responsible for determining the best method for funding and implementing applicable management practices. Several funding methods are outlined below. 
• 	
Water/Wastewater Rates -Water rates should be based on a local rate study and be sufficient to support program costs and facility maintenance. 

• 	
General Appropriations (General Fund) - Includes revenues from local taxes 

•	
 Loans/Bonds -Includes immediate borrowing of funds over a 15 to 20 year period with interest charges; typically used for capital improvement pro ects 

• 	
General Obligation Bonds - Based upon local government taxing powers 

• 	
Revenue Bonds - Based upon revenues generated by s specific entity for service fees and water/wastewater rates 

• 	
Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority Loans (GEFA) - Low interest state loans for environmental pro ects; the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund is administered by GEFA 

• 	
WaterFirst - Administered by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs; communities who apply for and become designated as WaterFirst communities receive discounts on GEFA loan interest rates 



• 	
Service Fees -Special taxes established by local governments for specific programs 

• 	
Grants -State or federal financial aid which may fully or partially fund pro ects; typically awarded on a competitive basis 

• 	
Section 19(h) - Under the federal Clean Water Act, Section 19(h) provides federal funding 

• 	
Federal Special Appropriations Act Pro ects (SAAP) cost-share program

7.4 Recommendations to the State 
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council has identified the following recommendations to the State. The Council intends these actions to begin following acceptance and issuance of the Regional Water Plan. These actions are for immediate action, action between now and the next update to the plan and for consideration in future updates to this plan. They are as follows 
. omprehensive Overhaul of the Water ontrol Manual and Operating Procedures 
The Council advocates that EPD review and further consider the model constraints and results performed by Dr. Georgakakos of the Georgia Water Resources Institute at Georgia Tech. The proposed changes in operating parameters for the federal reservoirs in the Chattahoochee River show significant improvement over the current RIOP and appear to provide a much better balance between water withdrawals, instream uses and the Congressional authorized purposes of the federal reservoirs. 
The Council recognizes that specific operating targets should come from more detailed modeling and analysis but in general, expect the outcomes to include more available storage in the reservoirs, more rapid refill after drought periods, higher lake levels especially on West Point Lake, and flow guidelines at the Columbus and Columbia planning nodes. The following modeling constraints (reference Table 5-1 from Section 5) are the beginning point for revisions to the Corps' water control manual. 
Furthermore, the Council requests that on its behalf that EPD convene a meeting with the U.S. Army Corps during the vetting process of the new water control manual and ask them to review the work of this Council and the preliminary modeling work done by the Georgia Water Resources Institute at Georgia Tech regarding adaptive reservoir management in the ACF basin. 
2. ask .orces for labama and nergy Water Use .orecasting 
Future Alabama water use needs were not provided for use in the development of this plan. In collaboration with the State of Alabama, withdrawal and return forecasts for Alabama water users of Chattahoochee River water through the forty year planning horizon should be developed. Utilizing current Alabama demands in the future condition analyses represents a lack of conservatism in the modeling work and is inconsistent with use of forecasted demands for Georgia water users. 
The EPD developed energy water use forecasting, however, this forecasting did not identify geographically specific water needs. Energy water use forecasting must be done to account for greater cooling tower efficiencies, 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 

additional energy conservation measures, increased power production in the future, water quality, and other factors as appropriate. 
The Council recommends that EPD designate task forces to develop improved water use forecasts that could be used in future updates of this plan. 
.. Metro orth istrict Returns and utrient . Sediment oading 
The May 7, 2009 Metro North District Plan includes ambitious predictions of returns to the river for which the Middle Chattahoochee resource assessments now greatly depend. The Council would like a comprehensive audit of these predictions and ongoing measurement and regular reporting on the progress to achieving these goals. Furthermore, the Council desires that such progress be reported as a range of statistical flows, including mean, minimum, and maximum values of consumptive use. 
The Middle Chattahoochee Council is also concerned about the nutrient load increase pro ected for 2050 that is estimated at the Whitesburg gauge. Nutrient loadings of phosphorus and nitrogen are expected to increase 200 percent by 2050. The Middle Chattahoochee region should not be burdened with additional waste water treatment or storm water BMPs caused by increases in upstream discharges. In addition, the Council is also concerned about sediment loading from upstream land management practices. 
Specific to nutrients, the Council is concerned about the increases in phosphorus and nitrogen and the resulting chlorophyll-a in West Point Lake and Lake Walter F. George and the potential for degradation of lake water quality. 
The Council requests that the Metro North District provide 1) specific details of how the increased nutrient and sediment loads will be mitigated before it reaches the Middle Chattahoochee basin, and 2) provide annual progress reports of nutrient and sediment levels and reduction effectiveness. 
Finally, the Council recommends a peer review of the lake and watershed models to better understand the methodology as it relates to the output and calibration. Pending the review, the council recommends that the model outputs not be utilized for setting water quality standards instream or for any other regulatory purposes, including point source permitting in the region. 
4. Science .ased etermination of .W Minimum Release 
Encourage State and Federal Agencies to reevaluate the scientific ustification for required minimum flows below Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam in the Apalachicola River. It is the opinion of this Council that the 5,000 cubic feet per second instantaneous flow target in the 1989 Water Control Manual 
00.U u:<.. <:00u:ww 

September 2011 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 

00.U u:<.. <:00u:ww 

(current operating plan when this plan was published) does not have sound scientific ustification. Furthermore, the Council recommends the analysis of alternative structural hydraulic measures such as temporary weirs, gates, and/or steps to control river stage and sediment transport and scour at or below Woodruff Dam in order to protect critical habitat. 
.. urther Research on .round.ater evelopment 
During the 2006-2007 drought, small surface water withdrawals and wells became more common to provide irrigation water to avoid irrigation restrictions. Because of the abundance of groundwater below the Fall Line, the cumulative impact of small groundwater withdrawals has the potential to significantly offset direct river withdrawals and thereby improve base flows. The Council asks EPD to encourage well development in those watersheds not directly impacted by surface water to groundwater interactions. The development should focus on wells in aquifers that may currently be under utilized to augment municipal, industrial and agricultural supplies as an alternative to continued dependence on ma or water courses such as the Chattahoochee River. 
In those areas of the Flint River where surface water to groundwater interactions are known to exist, the Council asks that EPD define the reduction in streamflow associated with increased agricultural groundwater withdrawals to aid in increased interregional coordination between the councils in the ACF Basin. A clear understanding of this effect will reveal the degree to which storage in the Chattahoochee River is relied upon to meet downstream flow requirements below Woodruff Dam. To achieve better agricultural water use data (both groundwater and surface water) the Council recommends improved implementation of the agricultural water withdrawal metering program of the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission by 
•	
 Completing comprehensive installation of meters 

•	
 Ensuring the meters are functioning properly through regular maintenance inspection 

• 	
Increasing data collection on parameters including monthly use, crops, inputs 

• 	
Reporting aggregate results annually to permittees and policymakers 

• 	
Preparing collected data in a manner that will facilitate use in future resource assessments 


.. 	Increase Storage in the System 
This Plan discusses the need to increase storage in the ACF system for both water withdrawal and instream uses and in the Tallapoosa Basin to mitigate modeled surface water availability gaps. Several means to increase storage are discussed, including better utilization of available storage, building more 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 

storage, and seeking to identify new methods of storage such as aquifer storage and recovery for areas with apparent gaps such as the Flint River Basin. 
The Council recommends that EPD develop these conceptual ideas further and provide a more comprehensive plan for increasing storage in the region. The concept of designating environmental storage in the existing federal reservoirs should be explored for the purpose of improving the reliability of meeting consumptive use and downstream flow targets during drought conditions. The Council encourages the study and development of new storage in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint and Tallapoosa basins to close gaps (Bainbridge, Heflin, and Newell nodes), improve reliability of drought contingency plans, and alleviate the burden of operational requirements on the federal reservoirs in the Middle Chattahoochee region which have become the .work horses. of the ACF system. 
7. Water onservation Program valuation 
The water conservation program is a critical element of this Plan. Currently there are several practical limitations to measuring progress such as inconsistent terminology, lack of available data and the need to identify practical ways of collecting data. Periodically, it will be important to assess the progress and benefit of the water conservation program. Recommendations throughout this plan are intended to address the existing limitations to the degree practicable to develop a sound method of measuring regional progress. 
.. unding for dditional Resource ssessments 
The Council recommends that the Legislature provide funding for ongoing additional data collection and the continued refinement of water resource assessments used in the development of the Plan. 
For water quantity, the Council recommends that the state consider further study of the modeling constraints associated with the adaptive reservoir management model for the ACF Basin developed by the Georgia Water Resources Institute at Georgia Tech. This action is recommended within the near-term leading up to the scheduled release of the draft Water Control Manual by the Corps of Engineers July 2011. Additionally, the Council recommends additional modeling scenarios which take into account extreme hydrologic conditions which have occurred outside of the modeled hydro­period currently established (19 8-2007) in the surface water availability models developed by EPD. This could include modeling extreme drought conditions documented from the 1920's and the extreme flood event which occurred in 2009.

00.U u:<.. <:00u:ww 

The Council also recommends an increased awareness of water balance in the region and therefore, requests that additional measurement and water return ratio studies be performed to better understand consumptive uses and related water returns. Once completed, this information will better equip the Council and region for managing consumptive uses and allow the Council's vision of an abundant water supply for our descendants to be achieved. 
The lack of baseline data for water quality as compared to the level of best management practice (BMP) implementation already in place, as well as a measure of the effectiveness of those practices, makes it difficult to assign management practices to address modeled water quality gaps. Additional funding for water quality assessments and best management practices (BMP) surveys could be complemented through the development of programs similar to those in already in place through the Georgia Forestry Commission or coordination of existing water quality sampling data already being collected to fulfill permit requirements. 
The Georgia Forestry Commission's BMP complaint and survey program could be considered as a model between agricultural users and the National Resource and Conservation Service (NRCS) and Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission (GSWCC). Such efforts would provide documentation necessary to substantiate the concerns of the agricultural community regarding nutrient, bacteria, and dissolved oxygen levels in streams. This program could also assist in a baseline set of observed water quality data versus applied BMPs throughout the region. 
Each municipality with a treated wastewater discharge is required to perform a watershed assessment and implementation plan. Each of the plans includes water quality monitoring. Municipalities could work together with EPD to develop monitoring networks that would complement the monitoring efforts of the EPD and others if funding were made available. 
.. Increase State unding for Implementation of Management Practices 
The Council recommends that EPD explore all possible funding sources to offset or pay for many of the management practices outlined in the Plan. Financial incentives and reimbursement for implementation of practices will expedite the progress needed to achieve the goals of the Plan. 
.. reation of Water Planning istricts and Interstate ompacts 
The Council recognizes the historical lack of sufficient study and funding for water planning in the State. The Council therefore recommends that the Legislature study and codify into state law, a plan whereby the planning, management and oversight of water and watershed resources in the state be delegated to stakeholder led water or watershed councils. The new water councils would have funding and staff for ongoing research, studies, 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 

assessments, measurement, monitoring and reporting on the progress of goals and future updates to the Plan. In the case of the Apalachicola­Chattahoochee-Flint Basin councils, the Council urges the state to also consider how these councils would function under an interstate compact. 
The Council recognizes and encourages the potential of an interstate compact for the ACF Basin. The Council also recognizes the examples of the Great Lakes Basin Compact, several of the Texas river basin compacts (i.e. Sabine River Compact Commission) and other successful stakeholder led water councils managing large river basins that cross geopolitical boundaries such as the Fraser River Basin Council, British Columbia, Canada. The creation of collective legislative action with member states with shared water resources should be developed to guide Florida, Georgia and Alabama on environmental, economic and operational issues relating to water resources management of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Basin. 
. oordinated Recommendations .ith eighboring ouncils 
Throughout the process of developing this plan, the Middle Chattahoochee Water Council met several times with neighboring regional water councils to discuss shared water resources and topics of concern. The Council met several times with the Upper Flint and Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Councils and developed a collaborative relationship with these councils that led to their agreement on a set of oint recommendations. 
The following oint recommendations were approved by all three councils Upper Flint, Lower Flint-Ochlockonee, and Middle Chattahoochee. The agreement among these councils on these recommendations indicates the importance of these recommendations to the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint System, of which all three councils are a part, and to the state as a whole. 
These oint recommendations overlap with some of the Middle Chattahoochee Water Council's own management practices and recommendations. Where overlap does occur, the Council does not see any conflict; usually, the Council's management practices and recommendations provide more detail than the oint recommendation. In all cases, the Council's own regional water plan takes precedence over the oint recommendations. 
The Middle Chattahoochee, Upper Flint, and Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Councils 
• 	
Recognize the critical need for more storage in the Apalachicola­Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) System and recommend that a plan for additional storage be developed and implemented and that it consider the following better utilization of existing storage in the Chattahoochee, new storage in the Flint, and enhancement of existing storage capacity. 

• 	
Urge EPD and those involved in the resource assessment modeling to improve upon existing models for future regional water planning by making greater use of actual and current data on water use and 


00.U u:<.. <:00u:ww

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 

conditions and by developing assumptions that more closely approximate actual conditions. 
• 	Request that state and federal agencies reevaluate the scientific ustification for the minimum flow requirements at Woodruff Dam that are intended to maintain healthy aquatic ecosystems. 
2. Regional Water Plan Use 
The State Water Plan specifies that regional water plans are to guide decisions regarding permitting.  The Middle Chattahoochee Council understands that its plan provides a valuable regional perspective and that this regional water plan will be an important new source of information for EPD and stakeholders.   Except where noted elsewhere, such as Council concerns regarding use of the water quality models, relevant provisions will inform EPD review and evaluation of factors that have to be balanced during permit review. 
However, the Council urges that EPD's permit decisions will continue to be based on the full existing framework of laws, rules, and guidance. Permit decisions should continue to rest upon consideration of the body of detailed information provided by an applicant, and adoption of this regional water plan will not substantially alter permitting processes. The Council expects that communications with permit applicants will be informed by the applicant.s familiarity with the contents of this adopted regional water plan and the ways in which the proposed activity addresses plan provisions. .

8.2 Plan Updates 
Meeting current and future water needs will require periodic review and revision of Regional Water Plans. The State Water Plan and associated rules provide that each Regional Water Plan will be subject to review by the appropriate Regional Water Planning Council every five years and in accordance with this guidance provided by the Director, unless otherwise required by the Director for earlier review. These reviews and updates will allow an opportunity to adapt the Regional Water Plan based on changed circumstances and new information arising in the five years after EPD’s adoption of these plans. These benchmarks will guide EPD in the review of the Regional Water Plan.   

8.3 Plan Extension Request 
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Council requested an extension in the time allocated for completion of this plan from the Georgia EPD and Georgia State legislators to allow for the proper completion of this planning document.  While the completion schedule was extended by approximately three months, there was much information that was still not available for the completion of this plan, including the Master Water Control Manual update by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.   

8.4 Plan Amendments 
The Middle Chattahoochee Council requests that amendments to this plan prior to the five-year update schedule as required by the State-wide Water Plan be expressly permitted. Plan amendments would need to be considered and approved by the Middle Chattahoochee Council in a similar manner as the development of this Water Development and Conservation Plan. All Council members would be allowed to propose an amendment, with any amendment approval requiring consideration during at least two called council meetings open to the public.
