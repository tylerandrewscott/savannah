Executive Summary 
Introduction and Overview of the Suwannee-Satilla Region 
Of all of Georgia’s natural resources, none is more important to the future of our State than water. Over the last several decades, Georgia has been one of the fastest growing states in the nation. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, between 2000 and 2010, Georgia ranked 4th in total population gain (1.5 million new residents) and 7th in percentage increase in population (18%). During a portion of this same period, our State also experienced unprecedented drought. Georgia’s growth and economic prosperity are vitally linked to our water resources. 
As our State has grown, the management and value of water resources has also changed. Ensuring a bright future for our State requires thoughtful planning and wise use of our water resources. In 2008, the State of Georgia’s leadership authorized a comprehensive state-wide water planning process to help address these challenges and take a forward look at how our State is expected to grow and use water over the next 40 years. The Suwannee-Satilla Regional Water Planning Council (Suwannee-Satilla Council) was established in February 2009 as part of this state-wide process. The Suwannee­Satilla Council is one of 11 planning regions charged with developing Regional Water Plans, and encompasses 18 counties in the southeastern portion of Georgia (shown in Figure ES-1). An overview of the initial findings and recommendations for the Suwannee-Satilla Region are provided in this Executive Summary. The Suwannee-Satilla Council’s Regional Water Plan is available at: www.suwanneesatilla.org. 


Georgia has abundant water resources, with 14 major river systems and multiple groundwater aquifer systems. These waters are shared natural resources; streams and rivers run through many political jurisdictions. The rain that falls in one region of Georgia may replenish the aquifers used by communities many miles away. And, while water in Georgia is abundant, it is not an unlimited resource. It must be carefully managed to meet long-term water needs. Since water resources vary greatly across the State, water supply planning on a regional and local level is the most effective way to ensure that current and future water resource needs are met.  

The Suwannee, Satilla, and St. Marys Rivers are a popular fishing resource to the region. There are several species of fish found in the rivers, offering excellent fishing for chain pickerel, warmouth, largemouth bass, bluegill, topminnow, sunfish, crappie, and catfish. The coastal estuaries of the Satilla and St. Marys Rivers also provide recreationally and commercially important ecosystems for fish, crustaceans, and shellfish. Several parks along these rivers provide an important recreational resource for the region, offering opportunities for various outdoor activities. Perhaps the most well known natural habitat and recreational resource in the region is the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. The Okefenokee Swamp is home to 233 bird species, 49 mammal species, 64 reptile species, and 37 amphibian species. The swamp is also home to over 600 species of plants. 
The Suwannee-Satilla Region encompasses several population centers, including the cities of Valdosta, Tifton, and Douglas. The Suwannee-Satilla Region is projected to grow by approximately 120,000 residents, or 30%, from 2010 to 2030 with the 
SUWANNEE-SATILLA 


Executive Summary 
highest growth occurring in Lowndes and Coffee Counties (Georgia’s Office of Planning and Budget, 2010). Based on this trend, the population of the region in 2050 will increase by approximately 247,000 people, or 63%, for a total of about 650,000 residents. To accommodate this growth, the region requires reliable water supplies and sufficient wastewater treatment to meet its growing needs. In addition, the region has a vibrant agricultural base that requires water supply to continue supporting the economics of the region.  
The primary economic sectors in the region include agriculture, forestry, professional and business services, education, healthcare, manufacturing, public administration, and construction. The rural economies of five counties in the region (Atkinson, Brantley, Charlton, Clinch, and Pierce Counties) are categorized as very or critically dependent on the forestry industry by the Georgia Forestry Commission in the 2008 report “Economic Impact of Forest Products Manufacturing in Georgia.” Forested lands and agriculture are major land covers in the region, which are also important drivers for the region’s economy. 
Establishing a Water Resource Vision for the Suwannee-Satilla Region 
A foundational part of the water planning process was the development of a vision for the region that describes the economic, population, environmental, and water use conditions that are desired for the region. On September 23, 2009, the Suwannee-Satilla Council adopted the following Vision for the region. 
“The Vision of the Suwannee-Satilla Regional Council is to manage water resources in a sustainable manner under Georgia’s regulated riparian and regulated reasonable use laws to support the state’s and region’s economy, to protect public health and natural resources, and to enhance the quality of life for all citizens; while preserving the private property rights of Georgia’s landowners, and in consideration of the need to enhance resource augmentation and efficiency opportunities.” 
On November 11, 2009, the Suwannee-Satilla Council identified 13 goals to complement the Vision. These goals can be found in Section 1 of the Regional Water Plan. 
In addition to providing these regional vision and goals, the Suwannee-Satilla Council believes it is critically important for the Council to have an ongoing role in regional water planning. The information in the Regional Water Plan is complex and will require ongoing education and an emphasis on cooperation to help obtain local support for, and maximize the effectiveness of the Plan’s recommendations. The leadership, knowledge and experience of the Suwannee-Satilla Council establishes a uniquely qualified group to assist in facilitating implementation of the Plan, clarifying questions regarding the intent of the Regional Water Plan recommendations, and refining and updating existing information as well as executing future planning efforts. More information regarding the region and its water resource needs, challenges, and solutions is provided below.      

Overview of Water Resources and Use in the Suwannee-Satilla Region 
Surface Water 
Major surface water features in the region include the Alapaha, Satilla, St. Marys, Suwannee, and Withlacoochee Rivers. The Alapaha and Withlacoochee Rivers are major tributaries to the Suwannee River, which flows through Florida into the Gulf of Mexico downstream of these confluences. The headwaters of the Suwannee River is in the Okefenokee Swamp. The Satilla River flows to the southeast and discharges to the Atlantic Ocean between Cumberland and Jekyll Islands. This water body is a blackwater stream consisting of tannins and other natural leachates, which cause the river to have a darkly stained appearance and have unique physical and chemical characteristics and dissolved oxygen dynamics. Over half (59%) of the St. Marys River lies in Georgia and the remainder is in Florida. The St. Marys River is also a blackwater stream. However, the St Marys River flows north and east, forming the border between southeast Georgia and northeast Florida and discharges into the Atlantic Ocean.  
As shown in Figure ES-2, surface water is expected to provide 27% of the water supply within the region. Based on water use trends and forecast information though 2050, the majority of the agricultural and industrial surface water use in the region is projected to come from the Suwannee River basin (74-76%) and Satilla River basin (22­24%), with the Ocmulgee and Flint River basins each making up 1% or less of the regional surface water use. This information is based on the assumption that future use will follow current practices and trends. 
Groundwater 

SUWANNEE-SATILLA 

As shown in Figure ES-2, groundwater is projected to meet about 73% of the region’s water supply needs. Based on 2010 forecasted groundwater withdrawal data, approximately 99% of groundwater in the region is supplied from the Floridan aquifer, which is one of the most productive groundwater aquifers in the United States. 
Water and Wastewater Needs in the Suwannee-Satilla Region – A Closer Look 
Figure ES-3 presents surface water and groundwater use by sector in the Suwannee-Satilla Region. Approximately 98% of surface water withdrawals in the region are for the agricultural sector, with the remaining 2% for industrial uses. About 128 MGD of groundwater withdrawn was predominantly used to supply agricultural (55%) and municipal users (28%) among others (self-supply and industrial). 


Wastewater treatment types representing current conditions in the region are shown in Figure ES-4. According to the Suwannee-Satilla Wastewater Forecast developed for the Regional Water Plan (CDM, 2011), 55% of treated wastewater in the region is disposed of as a municipal/industrial point source discharge or to a land application system (6%). The remaining wastewater is treated by on-site sewage treatment (septic) systems (38%). 
Suwannee-Satilla Forecasted Water Resource Needs from the Year 2010 to 2050 
Municipal water and wastewater 

forecasts are closely tied to population projections for the counties within the Suwannee-Satilla Region. The population projections were developed by the Georgia Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget and are shown in Figure ES-5. Overall, the region’s water supply needs are expected to grow by 24% (62 MGD) in demand from 2010 through 2050. Wastewater return flows are expected to grow by 46% (27 MGD) from 2010 through 2050.

Comparison of Available Resource Capacity to Future Water Resource Needs 
Groundwater Availability 
Groundwater is projected to meet about 73% of the region’s water supply needs. Groundwater from the Upper Floridan Aquifer is a vital resource for the Suwannee-Satilla Region. Overall, the results from the Groundwater Availability Resource Assessment (EPD, March 2010) indicate that the sustainable yield for the modeled portions of the regional aquifer(s) is greater than the forecasted demands. Therefore, at this time no groundwater resource shortfalls are expected to occur in the Suwannee-Satilla Region over the 40 year planning horizon. However, localized issues could arise in areas where there is a high well density and/or high volumes of groundwater withdrawal. 
Surface Water Availability 
Surface water is also an important resource used to meet current and future needs of the Suwannee-Satilla Region. In order to determine if there is sufficient surface water to meet both off-stream uses of water and instream flow needs, a Surface Water Availability Resource Assessment model was developed and used by EPD in the state water planning process. 
SUWANNEE-SATILLA 


The results of the future conditions modeling from the Surface Water Availability Resource Assessment (EPD, March 2010) show that in portions of the region, there are sufficient surface water supplies to meet forecasted water supply needs. However, in dry years, during some portions of the year, the modeled demand for off-stream uses of water results in projected impacts to instream flow needs (referred to as a “gap”).  
Figure ES-7 summarizes the locations in the region where there is a forecasted gap between available surface water resource and forecasted need. There are current and 2050 forecasted surface water gaps at the following locations in the region: Atkinson (Satilla River), Fargo (Suwannee River), Jennings (Alapaha River), Pinetta (Withlacoochee River) 
and Statenville (Alapaha River). At each of these locations, the dominant water use type is agricultural. The projected increase of agricultural and industrial surface water use for the counties within the Suwannee-Satilla Region that contribute to current and/or future gaps are 
9.54 MGD and 0.06 MGD, respectively. Since there are current gaps at the referenced locations, it will be difficult to 

develop additional surface water to meet projected needs without increasing current gaps. As described below, management practices are recommended by the Suwannee-Satilla Council to address surface water gaps. In Figure ES-7, the terms “planning node” and “basic node” refer to locations in the region with long-term river flow measurement data. In most instances, basic nodes are located at or near U.S. Geological Survey stream gages or at dams. Planning nodes are basic nodes where water availability assessments are performed. 

Executive Summary 
Assessment of Water Quality Conditions 
One measure of the capacity of surface water to maintain its health and the health of the aquatic species living therein is the amount of residual dissolved oxygen in the water. As part of the Surface Water Quality (Assimilative Capacity) Resource Assessment (EPD, March 2010), modeling of dissolved oxygen concentrations was performed for each surface water reach in the region that has upstream wastewater discharges to the reach. The modeling estimates the ability of the surface water to assimilate the amount of waste being discharged (also referred to as assimilative capacity). Each modeled river segment was classified as exceeding dissolved oxygen capacity, meeting dissolved oxygen capacity, or having available dissolved oxygen capacity. Table ES-1 summarizes the results of the assimilative capacity assessment for dissolved oxygen at baseline and/or permitted conditions including recommendations to address potential future (2050) water quality needs. Assimilative capacity assessments indicate the potential need for improved wastewater treatment in some facilities within the Suwannee and Satilla River Basins. Information is also included for portions of the river basin where additional treatment of nitrogen and/or phosphorus and/or ammonia may be needed.

Executive Summary 
Under Section 303d of the federal Clean Water Act, a total maximum daily load must be developed for waters that do not meet their designated uses. A total maximum daily load represents the maximum pollutant loading that a water body can assimilate and continue meeting its designated use (i.e., not exceeding State water quality standards). A water body is deemed to be impaired if it does not meet the applicable criteria for a particular pollutant; consequently, total maximum daily loads are required to be established for these waters to reduce the concentrations of the exceeding parameters in order to comply with State water quality standards. 
For the Suwannee-Satilla Region, there are 77 impaired stream reaches (total impaired length of 1,006 miles) and 2 impaired lakes (3,079 acres). Total maximum daily loads have been completed for 66 of the impaired stream reaches and 1 of the impaired lakes. The majority of impairments are due to low dissolved oxygen and fecal coliform. 
Identifying Water Management Practices to Address Water Resource Shortfalls and Future Needs 
The comparison of EPD’s March 2010 Resource Assessments and forecasted demands identified the region’s likely resource shortfalls or gaps and demonstrated the necessity for region and resource specific water management practices. In selecting the actions needed (i.e., water management practices), the Suwannee-Satilla Council considered practices identified in existing plans, the Region’s Vision and Goals, and coordinated with local governments and water providers as well as neighboring Councils that share these water resources. 
Summary of Resource Assessment Results  

Management Practices should be developed and implemented to address water resource shortfalls as determined by the three Resource Assessments.  Groundwater: Overall, results indicate that the sustainable yield for the modeled portions of the regional aquifer(s) is greater than the forecasted demands.  Surface Water Quantity: There are sufficient surface water supplies at several locations throughout the Suwannee-Satilla Region, but there are also projected surface water shortfalls during some periods of time at the Atkinson, Fargo, Jennings, Pinetta, and Statenville nodes. Surface Water Quality: There are four reaches within the Suwannee River Basin, four reaches within the Satilla River Basin, and one reach in the St. Marys River Basin that exceed assimilative capacity.   

The Suwannee-Satilla Council has developed a management practice strategy based on the best data and modeling results available. The Council recognizes that as data are refined and modeling results improve – including water and wastewater projections and Resource Assessments – the resulting future needs and gaps may change. Therefore, the Council has prioritized short-term management practices to address gaps with the understanding that more complex management practices may be required in the future.

Members of the Suwannee-Satilla Council have invested significant time and expertise into the planning process and wish to capitalize on the expertise gained by the Council prior to the end of their initial term as Council members (February 2012).  The Suwannee-Satilla Council believes the Regional Water Plan should be reviewed in defined increments in the future such as every five years to evaluate how the implemented management practices are performing toward addressing gaps and meeting forecasted needs and what additional measures might be required. If the selected management practices have not sufficiently addressed the gaps identified by the Resource Assessments, then additional management practices should be selected and implemented. Over time, the selected management practices will address identified gaps and meet future uses. Addressing surface water gaps will require that management practices also be implemented by adjacent water planning councils that share resources with the Suwannee-Satilla Council. 
Implementing Water Management Practices 
The Suwannee-Satilla Council supports the concept of regional water resource planning with a focus on planning Councils composed of local governments, water users, water providers, industry, business and affected stakeholders. Local representatives are typically most familiar with local water resource issues and 
SUWANNEE-SATILLA 


needs. The State has a vital role providing technical support, guidance, and funding to support locally focused water resource planning.  
Implementation of the Suwannee-Satilla Regional Water Plan will be primarily by various water users and wastewater utilities in the region. The most cost-effective and more readily implemented management practices will be prioritized for short­term implementation via an incremental and adaptive approach as shown in Figure ES-8. If resource needs are not met and/or gaps are not addressed, then more complex management practices will be pursued. Future planning efforts should confirm current assumptions and make necessary revisions and/or improvements to the conclusions reached during this round of planning. 

Cost Considerations 
Planning level cost estimates were prepared for the various categories of management practices. A detailed summary of costs can be found in Section 7 of the Regional Water Plan. In general, addressing surface water needs in the region from both a water supply and a water quality perspective are expected to present the largest challenges and have the most fiscal impact. For the Regional Water Plan to be most effective wastewater utilities and agricultural water users will need planning and implementation support to help them meet current and future needs. It is anticipated that several different funding sources and options will be used to secure funding for the various management practices outlined in the Regional Water Plan, and adequate funding will be a critical component of the successful implementation of the state-wide water planning effort.  
Water conservation remains a cost effective means to address future water supply needs and could be applied region-wide and especially in areas of limited future surface water withdrawals. Wastewater treatment will likely also require funding sources, both to upgrade plants and to address aging infrastructure. 

Executive Summary 
Implementation Considerations and Benchmarks – Helping Ensure Progress toward Meeting Future Needs 
Effective implementation of the Regional Water Plan will require the availability of sufficient funding in the form of loans, and in some cases, possibly grants. In addition, many of the proposed management practices require ongoing coordination with affected stakeholders/water users and collaboration to help ensure successful solutions are identified and implemented. Finally, in many cases monitoring progress toward addressing future needs will require improved data and information on the current actions and management practices that are already in place. 
To assess progress toward meeting regional needs, the Suwannee-Satilla Council identified several benchmarks, which can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Regional Water Plan. The benchmarks are shown in Section 8 of the Regional Water Plan and include both the activities to be accomplished and the measurement tools that can be used to assess progress. 
The Suwannee-Satilla Council supports the concept of regional water planning led by local representatives. The Council members wish to express their gratitude to former Governor Sonny Perdue, Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle, and former Speaker of the House Glenn Richardson for their nomination to the Suwannee-Satilla Council. The Regional Water Plan provides a recommended path forward to help achieve social, economic, and environmental prosperity for the region. The Council members are grateful for the opportunity to serve the region and State. The Suwannee-Satilla Council members wish to remain involved in facilitating attainment of the Regional Water Plan benchmarks and making necessary revisions to the Plan.

Section 1. Introduction 

The Suwannee-Satilla Council intends this Regional Water Plan to be a working document, and work on this planning process continues beyond this first iteration of the document. 
Over the last decade, Georgia was one of the fastest growing states in the nation. During this same period, the State experienced unprecedented drought. In addition, we have seen increased competition for water supplies, and our perspectives on how we use and value water have also changed. In response to these challenges, a State Water Council was formed to develop a state-wide water planning process. 
In 2008, the State Water Council submitted the 
Georgia Comprehensive State-wide Water Plan 
(State Water Plan) to the Georgia General Assembly and the water planning process was approved. The purpose of the State Water Plan is to guide Georgia in managing water resources in a sustainable manner to support the State’s economy, protect 


public health and natural systems, and to enhance the quality of life for all our citizens. The State Water Plan identifies state-wide policies, provides planning guidance, and establishes a planning process for completion of Regional Water Development and Conservation Plans (Regional Water Plans). The Suwannee-Satilla Regional Water Planning Council (Suwannee-Satilla Council) was formed to help guide the completion of the Regional Water Plan. The Suwannee-Satilla Council is composed of membership based on a nomination and appointment process by the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Speaker.  
1.1. The Significance of Water Resources in Georgia 
Of all Georgia’s natural resources, none is more important to the future of our State than water. The wise use and management of water is critical to support the State’s economy, to protect public health and natural 
September 2011  

systems, and to enhance the quality of life for all citizens. 
Georgia has abundant water resources, with 14 major river systems and multiple groundwater aquifer systems. These waters are shared natural resources. Streams and rivers run through many political jurisdictions. The rain that falls in one region of Georgia may replenish the aquifers used by communities many miles away. And, while water in Georgia is abundant, it is not an unlimited resource. It must be carefully managed to meet long-term water needs. 
Since water resources, their conditions, and their uses vary greatly across the State, selection and implementation of management practices on a regional and local level is the most effective way to ensure that current and future needs for water supply and assimilative capacity are met. Therefore, the State Water Plan calls for the preparation of ten Regional Water Plans. The eleventh regional water planning district, the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District (MNGWPD, also known as “the District”), was created by State law in 2001 and had existing Plans in place. Figure 1-1 illustrates the 11 council boundaries and major surface watersheds, which are shown by the different background colors. 
This Regional Water Plan prepared by the Suwannee-Satilla Council describes the current and projected water resource needs of the region and summarizes regionally appropriate management strategies (also referred to as water management practices) to be employed in Georgia’s Suwannee-Satilla Water Planning Region over the next 40 years to help meet these needs. 
1.2. State and Regional Water Planning Process 
The State Water Plan calls for the preparation of Regional Water Plans designed to manage water resources in a sustainable manner through 2050. This Regional Water Plan has been prepared following a consensus-based planning process illustrated in Figure 1-2. 

September 2011 

As detailed in the Suwannee-Satilla Council’s Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) and Department of Community Affairs (DCA) as well as the Suwannee-Satilla Council’s Public Involvement Plan (PIP), the process required and benefited from input of other regional water planning councils, local governments, and the public. 
1.3. The Suwannee-Satilla Water Planning Region Visions and Goals 
Following the process established in the State Water Plan, the Suwannee-Satilla Council was established in February 2009. The Suwannee-Satilla Council has 29 
members, which includes 3 alternates and 2 Ex-Officio Members. Figure 1-3 provides an overview of the Suwannee-Satilla Region and the residential locations of the Suwannee-Satilla Council members. 

The Suwannee-Satilla Council met collectively for the first time on March 13, 2009 at a kickoff meeting for the 10 regional water planning councils. The meeting focused on: providing an orientation to the water planning process; a preliminary overview of Georgia’s water resources; and establishing an understanding of the schedule for completing the Regional Water Plan, the Council’s meeting schedule, and requirements. 
Developing the Region’s Council Procedures 
Initially, the planning process focused on establishing the Suwannee-Satilla Council’s leadership along with operating procedures and rules for conducting meetings. The operating procedures and rules were appended to the Memorandum of Agreement that was executed between the Suwannee-Satilla Council, EPD, and DCA. The Memorandum of Agreement was unanimously approved by the Suwannee-Satilla Council and executed on June 24, 2009. A copy of this document can be accessed at: www.suwanneesatilla.org/documents/SSA_MOA_Signed-3.pdf. 

September 2011  

1. Introduction 
SUWANNEE-SATILLA 

In support of the Memorandum of Agreement, the Suwannee-Satilla Council formed six subcommittees to provide planning guidance during various development stages of the Regional Water Plan. The subcommittees consisted of the following:  Vision and Goals, Municipal Water and Wastewater Forecasting, Public Involvement Plan, Plan Drafting (Table of Contents), Plan Drafting (Report), and Management Practices. 
Developing Regional Vision and Goals 
A major element of Georgia’s state and regional water planning process is the identification of the region’s Vision and Goals that describe the economic, population, environmental and water use conditions desired for each region. The Vision and Goals described below summarize the Suwannee-Satilla Council’s priorities for water resource use and management. This information is used to help guide the identification and selection of water management practices for the Suwannee-Satilla Region and to communicate these priorities and values to other regions of the State. 
Vision Statement (As established September 23, 2009) 
“The Vision of the Suwannee-Satilla Regional Council is to manage water resources in a sustainable manner under Georgia’s regulated riparian and regulated reasonable use laws to support the state’s and region’s economy, to protect public health and natural resources, and to enhance the quality of life for all citizens; while preserving the private property rights of Georgia’s landowners, and in consideration of the need to enhance resource augmentation and efficiency opportunities.” 
Goals (As established November 11, 2009) 
The Suwannee-Satilla Council has identified 13 goals for the region. It is important to note that the goals summarized below are not presented in order of priority, but rather were assigned a number to identify specific goals addressed as part of the water management practice selection process (Section 6). 
1. 	
Manage and develop water resources to sustainably and reliably meet domestic, commercial, industrial water needs, and agricultural water needs including all agricultural sectors (this includes the agro forestry economy of the region). 

2. 	
Manage ground and surface water to encourage sustainable economic and population growth in the region. 

3. 	
Manage the region’s and state’s water resources in a manner that preserves and protects private property rights. 

4. 	
Ensure an adequate water supply of suitable quality to meet current and future human needs, while protecting environmental resources. 

5. 	
Identify opportunities to optimize existing and future supplies, and water and wastewater infrastructure. 

6. 	
Promote efficient use and management of surface and groundwater resources to allow for sufficient supplies for current and future generations.

The Suwannee-Satilla Council’s Public Involvement Plan 
A foundational principle of the Georgia water planning process is public and stakeholder participation and coordination among multiple interests. The Suwannee-Satilla Council developed a Public Involvement Plan to help guide and implement an inclusive planning process. The Public Involvement Plan was adopted by the Suwannee-Satilla Council on November 11, 2010 and can be accessed at: 
www.suwanneesatilla.org/documents/SSA_Public_Involvement_Plan_Adopted.pdf. 
Outreach to the public, local governments, water providers and users was accomplished by e-mail correspondence, direct communication, and updates provided by Council members at local government and other interest group meetings. Opportunity for public and local government comment was provided at each Council meeting. More information regarding public outreach can be found in the Suwannee-Satilla Public Outreach Technical Memorandum available at: 
www.suwanneesatilla.org/documents/Suwannee-SatillaPublicOutreachTM050211.pdf.

Section 2. The Suwannee-Satilla Water Planning Region 


2.1. History and Geography 
The Suwannee-Satilla Region is located within the Coastal Plain Physiographic Province. The topography of the region is characterized by gentle slopes that reflect the geologic history of marine incursions and regressions. Approximately 90% of the Coastal Plain’s sediments exposed in the area are sands and clays. The major land covers in the region are forested lands and agriculture, which are important drivers for the region’s economy. 
Surface Water Resources 
Figure 2-1 provides an overview of the surface water resources in the Suwannee-Satilla Region. Major surface water features in the region include the Alapaha, Satilla, St. Marys, Suwannee, and Withlacoochee Rivers. Major lakes in the region include Banks Lake. 


The Alapaha and Withlacoochee Rivers are major tributaries to the Suwannee River, which flows into the Gulf of Mexico downstream of these confluences. The headwaters of the Suwannee River is in the Okefenokee Swamp. The Suwannee River is 266 miles long and has a drainage area of approximately 11,000 square miles (mi2), 51% of which lies in Georgia (EPD, 2002) and the remainder in Florida. This water body is a blackwater stream consisting of tannins and other natural leachates, which cause the river to have a darkly stained appearance and unique physical and chemical characteristics, including dissolved oxygen dynamics. 
September 2011  

The Satilla River flows to the southeast across the region from its headwaters in Ben Hill County and discharges to the Atlantic Ocean between Cumberland and Jekyll Islands (EPD, 2002). The Satilla River is 200 miles long and has a drainage area of approximately 3,940 mi2, which is completely contained within Georgia. Like the Suwannee River, the Satilla River is a blackwater stream.  
The St. Marys River is 90 miles long and has a drainage area of approximately 1,300 mi2, 59% of which lies in Georgia (EPD, 2002) and the remainder in Florida. Like the Suwannee River, the St. Marys River is a blackwater stream. The St. Marys River flows north and east, forming the border between southeast Georgia and northeast Florida before discharging into the Atlantic Ocean. 
The Suwannee, Satilla, and St. Marys Rivers are popular fishing resources to the region. There are several species of fish found in the rivers, offering excellent fishing for chain pickerel, warmouth, largemouth bass, bluegill, topminnow, sunfish, crappie, and catfish. The coastal estuaries of the Satilla and St. Marys Rivers also provide recreationally and commercially important ecosystems for fish, crustaceans, and shellfish. 
Several parks along these rivers provide an important recreational resource for the region, offering opportunities for various outdoor activities. Some of the more popular parks in the region include General Coffee State Park in Nichols, the Cumberland Island National Seashore, Reed Bingham State Park near Adel, and Crooked River State Park. Perhaps the most well known natural habitat and recreational resource in the region is the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. The Okefenokee Swamp is home to 233 bird species, 49 mammal species, 64 reptile species, and 37 amphibian species. The swamp is also home to over 600 species of plants. 
Groundwater Resources 
Groundwater is a very important resource for the Suwannee-Satilla Region. Figure 2-2 depicts the major aquifers of Georgia. Based on 2010 projected pumping data provided by Georgia EPD, approximately 99% of groundwater supplied in the region is from the Floridan aquifer, which is one of the most productive groundwater aquifers in the United States. The Floridan aquifer is primarily comprised of limestone, dolostone, and calcareous sand. The aquifer is generally confined, but at its northern 

SUWANNEE-SATILLA 

September 2011 

extent there are unconfined and semi-confined zones. The Floridan aquifer increases in thickness eastwardly across the State and is approximately 400 feet thick in Glynn County. The aquifer is very productive, with typical well yields of 1,000-5,000 gallons per minute. 
The eastern portion of the Suwannee-Satilla Region is within the Brunswick aquifer area, which consists of sands and limestones. Where this aquifer exists, it is used in addition to the Floridan aquifer for water supply. The surficial aquifer, which is present beneath most of the Coastal Plain area, is usually not very thick and not typically used as a primary source of water supply. 
The Suwannee-Satilla Region shares its groundwater resources with portions of North Florida. EPD coordinated with the Suwannee River Water Management District and St. Johns River Water Management District to obtain current Florida groundwater use data, which were incorporated into groundwater modeling efforts. 
Climate 
A review of data for the region from the Southeast Regional Climate Center indicates that the climate is temperate with mild winters and hot summers. Average maximum temperatures are around 92°F in July and average minimum temperatures are near 40°F in January. The area receives abundant rainfall, approximately 46-52 inches per year, with the greatest rainfall occurring during July and August. The driest month in the region is November. Snowfall is rare and the historical average for the region is 0.1 inches. 
2.2. Characteristics of Region 
The Suwannee-Satilla Council encompasses 18 counties in the southeastern portion of Georgia, with a projected 2010 population of approximately 403,000 (Office of Management and Budget, 2010). The counties and major towns and cities are shown in Figure 2-1. The major population centers in the region include the cities of Valdosta, Tifton, and Douglas. 
Based on information obtained from Georgia Department of Labor Local Area Profiles, major employers in the regions include Bway Corporation, Inc. and Lee Container Corps in Clinch County, Shaw Industries Group Inc. in Tift and Ben Hill Counties, Heatcraft Refrigeration Products, LLC in Tift County, and the Moody Air Force Base in Lowndes and Lanier Counties. The rural economies of five counties in the region (Atkinson, Brantley, Charlton, Clinch, and Pierce Counties) are categorized as very or critically dependant on the forest community by the Georgia Forestry Commission in the 2008 report “Economic Impact of Forest Products Manufacturing in Georgia”. There are five forestry products manufacturing facilities within the region. The raw materials to sustain these facilities are also supplied by the region. Two examples of industries that rely on the region’s water resources for its operations are Pilgrim’s Pride (chicken processing) and Premium Waters, Inc. (bottled water), which are both located in Coffee County. The primary economic 
September 2011  

sectors in the region include agriculture, forestry, professional and business services, education, healthcare, manufacturing, public administration, and construction. 
Agriculture has historically played a dominant role in the economy of the Suwannee-Satilla Region and the State. During 2007, Georgia agriculture generated more than $7.1 billion in cash receipts to the State's economy, with the Suwannee-Satilla Region contributing approximately $821 million (2007 Census of Agriculture; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2009). According to the USDA Economic Research Service, farming’s contribution to state and national economies can be determined by calculating the net value added, which is the total value of the agricultural sector’s production of goods and services less payments to other sectors of the economy. The farm production net value added for the Suwannee-Satilla Region represents 14% of the total state farm net value added in 2007. The Suwannee-Satilla farm production net value added represents 0.12% of the total State gross domestic product (GDP), which was $399 billion in 2007 (U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis). Turner, Irwin, Tift, Brooks, Berrien, and Cook Counties are expected to continue to be the higher agricultural water use areas of the region. 
While forestry and agriculture have, and will continue to be major economic drivers in the region, a number of areas will experience increased urbanization and increases in commercial and industrial growth. These trends are especially likely to be seen in Coffee, Lowndes, and Tift Counties among others. 
The region includes four colleges and universities within the University System of Georgia: Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College in Tifton, Valdosta State University, South 

Georgia College in 
SUWANNEE-SATILLA 

Douglas, and Waycross College. The region also includes three colleges within the Technical College System of Georgia: Wiregrass Technical College in Valdosta, Douglas, and Fitzgerald, Okefenokee Technical College in Waycross, and Moultrie Technical College in Tifton. In addition to county jails, there are six correctional facilities which are important employers and water users in the Suwannee-Satilla Region. 
A summary of 2005 land cover distribution is shown in Figure 2-3, based on data 

September 2011 

obtained from the University of Georgia Natural Resources Spatial Analysis. Forests cover 36% of the Suwannee-Satilla Region, and wetlands and agriculture cover 26% and 22% of the region, respectively. It should be noted that the term wetland refers to land cover and does not infer a regulatory determination. Urban development accounts for only 5% of the land cover within the region. The remaining land cover (11%) consists of water and open spaces. Based on the inventory developed of Georgia’s irrigated croplands for 2008 (UGA Cooperative Extension Irrigation Survey and Dr. Jim Hook), more than half of the irrigated acreage within the Suwannee Satilla Region is dominated by cotton and peanuts. Fresh vegetables and corn are also planted widely in the region. 
2.3. Local Policy Context 
Regional Commissions 
Regional Commissions are agencies of local governments and representatives from the private sector that facilitate coordinated and comprehensive planning at the local and regional levels. Regional Commissions often assist their membership with conformity to minimum standards and procedures and serve as liaisons with state and federal agencies. There are 12 Regional Commissions in Georgia. The Southern Georgia Regional Commission covers the same counties as the Suwannee-Satilla Council. 
In July 2009, the Georgia Department of Community Affairs required the Regional Commissions to adopt, maintain, and implement a Regional Plan (DCA Rule 110-12­6). The Southern Georgia Regional Commission’s Regional Plan provides guidance to regional and local business leaders, local governments, state and federal agencies, and citizens to promote quality growth in region. It is a vision of the future for the region and includes quality community based objectives related to water resources such as water supply, wastewater, and stormwater management. A key component is the establishment of “performance standards”, which are actions, activities, or programs a local government can implement or participate in that will advance their efforts to meet the vision of the Regional Plan. The Southern Georgia Regional Commission’s Regional Plan defines two achievement thresholds (Minimum and Excellence), which are attained by implementing the performance standards. Local governments are required to achieve the Minimum Standard to maintain their Qualified Local Government status, which qualifies them for certain state funding. By achieving the Excellence Standard, a local government may be eligible for special incentives. The Southern Georgia Regional Commission is expected to complete the Regional Plan by 2013.

Section 3. Water Resources of the Suwannee-Satilla Region 



3.1. Current Major Water Use in Region 
Based on data summarized from the 2009 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) report “Water Use in Georgia by County for 2005; and Water-Use Trends, 1980-2005,” water supply in the Suwannee-Satilla Region for 2005 totaled approximately 175 million gallons per day (MGD) and was comprised of 73% groundwater and 27% surface water, as shown in Figure 3-1. Figure 3-2 shows surface water in the region was used almost entirely for agriculture (98%) with the remaining 2% used by industry. A total of 128 MGD of groundwater withdrawn was predominantly used to supply agricultural (55%) and municipal users (28%) among others (self­supply and industrial), as shown in Figure 3-3. Wastewater treatment types in the region are shown in Figure 3-4. According to the Suwannee-Satilla Water and Wastewater Forecasting Technical Memorandum (CDM, 2011), 55% of treated wastewater in the region was disposed of as a municipal/industrial point source discharge or to a land application system (6%). The remaining wastewater was treated by on-site sewage treatment (septic) systems (38%).  
3.2. Resource Assessments 
EPD developed three Resource Assessments to evaluate surface water quality, surface water availability, and groundwater availability throughout the State. These assessments determined the capacity of water resources to meet demands for water supply and wastewater discharge without unreasonable impacts according to metrics established by EPD. The assessments were completed on a resource basis (river basins and aquifers), but are summarized herein as they relate to the Suwannee-Satilla Region. As described in more detail below, the term “gap” is used to indicate when the current or 

September 2011  

future use of water has been identified as potentially exceeding the long-term sustainability of the water resource. Full details of each Resource Assessment can be found at: www.georgiawaterplanning.org/pages/resource_assessments. 

SUWANNEE-SATILLA 

3.2.1. Current Surface Water Quality (Assimilative Capacity) 
The Surface Water Quality (Assimilative Capacity) Resource Assessment (EPD, March 2010) estimates the capacity of Georgia’s surface waters to absorb pollutants without unacceptable degradation of water quality. The term assimilative capacity refers to the ability of a water body to naturally assimilate pollutants via chemical and biological processes without exceeding State water quality standards or harming aquatic life. The current (also referred to as baseline) assimilative capacity results focus on dissolved oxygen (DO), and nutrients in some areas of the State (specifically nitrogen and phosphorus), and chlorophyll-a (a parameter that is closely tied to lake water quality). The assessments evaluate the impact of current

stream.  As shown in Table 3-1 
and Figure 3-5, DO modeling was performed by EPD for each reach that has upstream wastewater dischargers (light blue segments). Each segment was classified as exceeding DO capacity, meeting DO capacity, or having available DO capacity. The results of the current DO modeling are presented in Figure 3-6 for the Suwannee-Satilla Region, which includes portions of the Suwannee, Satilla, and St. Marys River basins. This baseline assimilative capacity represents the model results based on discharge amounts as reported by wastewater treatment plants in 2007. When reviewing the figures, the following points should be kept in mind: segments shown with exceeded assimilative capacity may result from a number of factors including point and/or non-point sources of pollutants, modeling assumptions regarding wastewater discharge, stream flow and temperature, and naturally low DO conditions in the receiving stream. When model results show DO assimilative capacity as exceeded, a potential “gap” exists between the amount of pollutants discharged and the ability of the receiving stream to assimilate the pollutants. These points were considered when developing recommended strategies to address water quality needs in the region.

Nutrient Modeling 
In addition to Assimilative Capacity modeling for DO, EPD completed nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorous) modeling for the Satilla River watershed. The location of the watershed model boundaries, and lakes, harbors and estuaries model locations are shown in Figure 3-5. It should be noted that only current conditions nutrient modeling was performed. There are currently no nutrient standards for nitrogen and phosphorus, but these standards may be established in forthcoming years. The watershed models show non-point source nutrient loadings of phosphorus and nitrogen to the Brunswick Harbor. The Suwannee-Satilla Council proactively identified several non-point source best management practices (BMPs) that can be used to help reduce nutrient loading as discussed in Section 6. 
3.2.2. Current Surface Water Availability 
The Surface Water Availability Resource Assessment (EPD, March 2010) estimates the availability of surface water to meet current and future municipal, industrial, agricultural, and thermal power water needs as well as the needs of instream and downstream users. Instream uses include fish, wildlife habitat, recreation, and dilution of wastewater, among others. The March 2010 Surface Water Availability Resource Assessment used specific 

minimum flow levels as indicators of the ability to support instream uses. Minimum instream flows were based on State policy, existing Federal Policy, or existing Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) license requirements. The results of the assessment are provided in terms of both severity (i.e., the amount by which the stream flow would drop below minimum instream flow requirements) and frequency (i.e., number of days below minimum instream flow requirements).    
As shown in Figure 3-7, there are several surface water planning nodes located in the Suwannee-Satilla Region (shown as yellow circles with red triangles). Planning nodes are locations along a river where there is a long-term record of river flow measurements.  At each node, the surface water availability models applied the current cumulative upstream consumptive uses of water (i.e., withdrawals minus returns) and authorized reservoir operations to stream flows from 1939 to 2007.  For

the surface water assessment, the term “gap” is used when the mathematical modeling results indicate that forecasted off-stream uses of water increase the severity and/or frequency of critical low flow periods.  Surface water gaps exist under current conditions at the following planning nodes: Atkinson (Satilla River), Jennings (Alapaha River), Pinetta (Withlacoochee River), and Statenville (Alapaha River). There is also a potential gap at Fargo, however, it is not considered significant. At these nodes, during certain low flow periods, there is not sufficient water to meet current off-stream demands and also meet the targets for support of instream uses. 
In the Suwannee-Satilla Region and surrounding area, critical low flow conditions occur on river systems that do not have any upstream storage reservoirs. In these situations, the Surface Water Availability Resource Assessment uses the unimpaired (meaning estimated flows without off-stream uses) monthly 7 day low flow that occurred over a 10 year period or the daily unimpaired flow (whichever is the lowest value) to determine the critical low flow level/target. It is important to note that when a surface water gap exists, management practices are needed to address times when off-stream uses increase the severity and/or frequency of critical low flow conditions. Low flow conditions have been and will continue to occur; and the Suwannee-Satilla Council’s management practices are not utilized to address naturally occurring low flow conditions. 
Table 3-2 shows modeled results with information on the size of projected current gaps, with current withdrawals, expressed as changes to natural flow conditions. The values are presented as an average annual flow rate and it is important to note that this summary does not take into account seasonal peaks in consumption and the effects on river flows on a monthly basis.  Additional analysis was performed to assess monthly flow conditions.  For example, impacts to stream flows are higher in the summer months and lower in the winter months. Additional details are provided in the Suwannee-Satilla Gap Analysis Technical Memorandum (CDM, 2011).

3.2.3. Current Groundwater Availability 
The Groundwater Availability Resource Assessment (EPD, March 2010) estimates the sustainable yield for prioritized groundwater resources based on existing data. EPD prioritized the aquifers based on the characteristics of the aquifer, evidence of negative effects, anticipated negative impacts, and other considerations. This 
September 2011 

3. Water Resources of the  Suwannee-Satilla Region 
assessment identified the sustainable yield, or the volume of groundwater that can be used without negative impacts. Negative impacts include limiting use of neighboring wells (drawdown as a consequence of withdrawal), significantly reducing groundwater contributions to stream baseflows, and the permanent reduction of groundwater levels. If negative impacts occur or are expected to occur, then a groundwater “gap” exists. The Suwannee-Satilla Region will coordinate usage with other water planning regions to meet the sustainable yield for each groundwater source. 

Groundwater from the Upper Floridan Aquifer is a vital resource for the Suwannee-Satilla Region. In 2005, groundwater was relied upon to meet around 73% of the water use in the region (USGS, 2009). The Suwannee-Satilla Region shares its groundwater resources with portions of North Florida. Coordination was conducted with the Suwannee River Water Management District and St. Johns River Water Management District to obtain current Florida groundwater use data, which were incorporated into the Groundwater Availability Resource Assessment (EPD, March 2010). Overall, the results from the March 2010 Groundwater Availability Resource Assessment indicate that on a regional basis, for the prioritized aquifers, there is sufficient groundwater supply to meet current needs. However, localized issues may occur if groundwater well densities or withdrawal rates are greater than the scenarios evaluated in the Resource Assessment. For the 
Suwannee-Satilla Region, the Resource Assessment model boundary for the sustainable yield estimates did not include southern Ware, southern Brantley, and Charlton Counties as these counties are included in an ongoing United States Geological Survey model of the Upper Floridan Aquifer and, therefore, were not included in the Eastern Coastal Plain model boundaries for the Resource Assessment.  
As shown in Figure 3-8, 24 counties in southeast Georgia are subject to the Coastal Georgia Water and Wastewater Permitting Plan for Managing Salt Water Intrusion 
September 2011

(Coastal Permitting Plan) (www.gadnr.org/cws/). There are five counties (Bacon, Brantley, Charlton, Pierce, and Ware Counties) in the Suwannee-Satilla Region that are located within the Green Zone. Per the Coastal Permitting Plan, there are no pumping restrictions from the Upper Floridan Aquifer in this area; however, there are water conservation requirements related to groundwater withdrawals. 
3.3. Current Ecosystem Conditions and Instream Uses 
The Suwannee-Satilla Region encompasses parts of the Southern Coastal Plain and Southeastern Plains ecoregions. The rivers in these ecoregions support a diversity of fish and wildlife species and provide numerous recreational opportunities. The Department of Natural Resources manages one Public Fishing Area (Berrien County) and two Wildlife Management Areas (Coffee and Ware Counties) in the Suwannee-Satilla Region. The Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge (Ware, Charlton, and Clinch Counties) contains one of the largest peat-based freshwater swamps in the world and is home to over 400 species of animals.  All of these areas provide public access to rivers and lakes for fishing, hunting, and other recreational activities. 
With over 1.29 million resident anglers, fishing is the most popular wildlife-related activity in Georgia (GADNR-WRD 2006). The Suwannee River, which begins in Georgia and discharges into the Gulf of Mexico, is well-known to anglers for its warmouth, flier, chain pickerel, and bullhead catfish.  The Satilla and St. Marys rivers, which discharge into the Atlantic Ocean, are better known for their redbreast sunfish, bluegill, redear sunfish, black crappie, largemouth bass, and catfish. Because they are directly linked to Georgia’s coastal ecosystem, the Satilla and St. Marys rivers also support commercial fisheries in Georgia for blue crabs, shrimp, and eels, and recreational fisheries for nearshore species such as red drum and sea trout. 
The Satilla and St. Marys rivers provide important riverine habitat for small populations of shortnose sturgeon, Atlantic sturgeon, American shad, and American eel—all diadromous species which travel between the ocean and freshwater rivers to breed—as well as striped bass, a very popular sport fish. Because these populations are small and depend on varying mixtures of salt and fresh water at different life stages, they are susceptible to changes in water quality and flow. 
The 2005 Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy identified 71 high priority animals that inhabit the southern Coastal Plain ecoregion and 85 high priority animals in the Southeastern Plains ecoregion (more information is available at www.georgiawildlife.com/node/1370). Several of these amphibians, fish, mammals, mollusks, and reptiles depend on rivers for part or all of their lifecycle. Federally endangered species in the Suwannee-Satilla Region that inhabit rivers include the shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum). There are 25 identified high priority habitats in the Southern Coastal Plain ecoregion and 27 high priority habitats in the Southeastern Plains (CWCS, 2005) (for more information on high priority waters and protected species go to www.georgiawildlife.com/node/1377 and 
September 2011 

3. Water Resources of the  Suwannee-Satilla Region 
www.georgiawildlife.com/node/1366). Riverine systems and processes are important to many of these habitats such as alluvial rivers and swamps, bottomland hardwood forests, blackwater streams, canebreaks, and open-water ponds and lakes. 
In the Southern Coastal Plain ecoregion, conservation lands make up 14% of the land area. The percentage of lands in conservation is lower in the Southeastern Plains ecoregion at 2.6% (CWCS, 2005). Several rivers and watersheds in this planning region have been identified as ecologically important including the St. Marys, Ocmulgee, and Suwannee rivers. These high priority streams and watersheds are considered important for the conservation of at least one high priority habitat or species and were identified during the development of WRD’s Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy (2005).  
The Satilla and St. Marys Rivers flow from the Suwannee-Satilla Region through the Coastal Regional Council boundary and discharge to the Atlantic Ocean. The coastal area contains a unique combination of fresh, brackish and salt water environments. The area is defined by barrier islands, sand beaches, open Atlantic Ocean, and there are 9 major estuaries including 350,000 acres of salt marsh and 150,000 acres of open water. Shipping channels are maintained in three estuaries–the lower Savannah River, St. Simons, and Cumberland. Otherwise, the remainder is very similar in depth, size and other physical characteristics as they were at the time of European settlements of Georgia. 
An estuary is a semi-enclosed body of water, which has a free connection with the sea and within which sea water is measurably diluted with fresh water.  Without the fresh water input, such areas in Georgia would be salt water lagoons or bays. A key characteristic of an estuary is salinity, which can be highly variable depending on the location within the estuary and the estuaries itself. Sources of fresh water for an estuary include: fresh water river discharges, industrial and municipal discharges of groundwater after use and treatment, and upwelling of groundwater through geologic features. Estuarine environments support a diversity of life, both aquatic and terrestrial, unparalleled in other portions of the State.  Hundreds of species of animals and plants exist because of the unique mixing of salt water and fresh water. If the fresh water were removed, the diversity would change immensely from what is found today. Maintaining freshwater inputs to Georgia’s estuaries is vital for maintaining a unique coastal environment, which provides a myriad of social and economic benefits, as well as invaluable ecological services to the citizens of Georgia.

Impaired Water Bodies 
Under Section 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA), a total maximum daily load (TMDL) must be developed for waters that do not meet their designated uses. A TMDL represents the maximum pollutant loading that a water body can assimilate and continue meeting its designated use (i.e., not exceeding State water quality standards). A water body is deemed to be impaired if it does not meet the applicable criteria for a particular pollutant; consequently, TMDLs are required to be established 
September 2011  

3. Water Resources of the Suwannee-Satilla Region 
for these waters to reduce the concentrations of the exceeding parameters in order to comply with State water quality standards. For the Suwannee-Satilla Region, there are 77 impaired stream reaches (total impaired length of 1,006 miles) and 2 impaired lakes (total impaired area of 3,079 acres). 
Of the impaired reaches in the region (note that a reach may be impaired for more than one parameter): 
. 	51% are impaired for 
fecal coliform 

. 	47% are impaired for low 
dissolved oxygen 

. 	18% are impaired for 
trophic-weighted residual 
mercury in fish tissue 

. 	4% are impaired for 
macroinvertebrate 
community impacts 

. 	3% are impaired for fish 
community impacts 

. 3% are impaired for pH 
Both impaired lakes in the region are impaired for trophic-weighted residual mercury in fish tissue. TMDLs have been completed for 66 of the impaired stream reaches and 1 of the impaired lakes, as shown in Figure 3-9.  The Suwannee-Satilla Council categorized these TMDL listed segments and more information on the listed segments can be found in the Suwannee-Satilla Gap Analysis Technical Memorandum (CDM, 2011).

Section 4. Forecasting Future Water Resource Needs 
Water and wastewater demand forecasts, along with the Resource Assessments (Section 3), form the foundation for water planning in the Suwannee-Satilla Region and serve as the basis for the selection of management practices (Sections 6 and 7). This section presents the regional water and wastewater forecasts for 10-year intervals from 2010 through 2050 for four water use sectors: municipal, industrial, agriculture, and thermoelectric generation. 
During the regional planning process, the majority of Suwannee-Satilla Council members identified the following objectives for the forecast process. The two primary objectives were: 
. Ensuring accurate data, and 
. Ensuring that data are not used to establish 
regional or local mandates. 

Central to these objectives is the overarching goal to develop consistent and comparable sets of data. This means that select data sets (common year for data inputs and comprehensive coverage of the State) in many cases have broader coverage of the State, but may not be as precise as local provider level data. During development of the Regional Water Plan, there was a concerted effort to strike a balance between broad coverage and local data.  This was accomplished by using consistent data collection on a regional basis modified as appropriate with local provider input. These data and resulting forecasts are not applicable between regions or between providers within the region. 

The methodology to forecast water and wastewater demands is based primarily on the assumption that there will be a continuation of existing trends and practices. It does not make a determination regarding the efficiency or inefficiency of forecasted demands, only that they are expected to occur given current trends. Initial forecasting does not take into account management practices, including water conservation (other than passive conservation as described in more detail below) that may be adopted by Regional Water Planning Councils to reduce the expected magnitude of demand (see Sections 6-8 for additional details on water conservation and other management practices). Additionally, this forecasting effort does not change EPD requirements related to individual permitting decisions, but represents a forecast for regional water planning that will help guide permitting and funding decisions.

4. Forecasting Future WaterResource Needs 



4.1. Municipal Forecasts 
Municipal water includes water supplied to residences, commercial businesses, and small industries (those not included in the major industrial sectors are identified in Section 4.2). Residential water uses include water for normal household purposes: cooking, bathing, and clothes washing, among others.  Commercial water uses include water used by hotels, restaurants, retail stores, and office buildings, among others. Municipal water demands may be served by public water systems, private water systems, or self-supplied by the user (such as individual wells). 
Population Projections 
Municipal water and wastewater forecasts are closely tied to population projections for the counties within the Suwannee-Satilla Region. The population projections were developed by the Georgia Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget, which is charged in State law (O.C.G.A. 45-12-171) with the responsibility for preparing, maintaining, and furnishing official demographic data for the State. The population projection results by county are shown in Table 4-1.

4. Forecasting Future WaterResource Needs 
Municipal Water Forecasts 
The municipal water forecasts were calculated by multiplying the baseline per capita water use rate by the population served. Per capita water use rates are different for public water systems in comparison to self-supplied water use; therefore, the demands are calculated separately and then summed together. The publicly­supplied water use rate was determined for each county within the region.  The self­supply per capita demand is estimated at 100 gallons per capita per day (gpcd).  
The forecasted water use rates for the Suwannee-Satilla Region were further adjusted based on two plumbing code changes, which mandate new water saving lavatory fixtures. The National Energy Policy Act of 1992 reduced the maximum toilet flush volume from 3.5 to 1.6 gallons per flush for all toilets available in the U.S. starting in 1994.  The Georgia Water Stewardship Act of 2010 reduces the maximum flush volume to 1.28 gallons per flush for all new toilets installed in Georgia after July 1, 2012. As new homes are constructed and less efficient toilets are replaced within existing housing stock, the water use rate is reduced over time. Additional information on plumbing code efficiency adjustments and rationale for per capita water use is available in the Suwannee-Satilla Water and Wastewater Forecasting Technical Memorandum (CDM, 2011). Table 4-2 summarizes the estimated water savings from both acts. On a regional basis, municipal water demands are expected to be about 8% lower as a result of water demand reduction (6 MGD in 2050) that can be attributed to passive conservation.

Total municipal water demands are shown in Figure 4-1 for the Suwannee-Satilla Region. In addition, this figure shows the distribution in demands resulting from public water systems and self-supply systems.  In the Suwannee-Satilla Region, all municipal water demands are satisfied by utilizing groundwater as the sole source for withdrawals.

Municipal Wastewater Forecasts 
Municipal wastewater forecasts are based on estimates of indoor municipal (public and self supplied) water use. Indoor water use may be treated by centralized treatment plants or onsite sanitary sewage (septic) systems. Centralized treatment plants may discharge to a water body or to a land application system.. 
Estimates of wastewater generated from publicly-supplied and self-supplied water use (from the passive conservation scenario above) were calculated and then assigned to septic and centralized wastewater flows. U.S. Census data on the percent of households with septic systems were obtained by county. For planning purposes, it was estimated that 100% of the wastewater generated from self­supplied water use is disposed of via septic system. Dividing the number of municipally supplied households on septic by the U.S. Census estimate of the number of households by county provided an estimate of the percent of municipally supplied households that discharged to septic systems in 2005. 
Estimates of flows treated at centralized wastewater treatment plants are derived from the portion of wastewater flow that is not septic. In addition, a percent of flow is added to account for infiltration and inflow (I/I) that occurs in the wastewater collection system before reaching the treatment facility. I/I is a term used to describe groundwater and stormwater that enters into the dedicated wastewater system. An initial value of 20% was used to calculate return flows.  
Finally, wastewater effluent flow from centralized treatment facilities is either discharged as a point source to a receiving water body or to a land application system. Information obtained from existing EPD permit data as well as feedback from municipal suppliers was used to determine the ratio of point discharge to land

4.2. Industrial Forecasts 
Industrial water and wastewater forecasts anticipate the future needs from the following major water-using industries within the Suwannee-Satilla Region: mining, food, textile, apparel, paper, chemicals, fabricated metals, and electrical equipment. Industries require water for processes, sanitation, cooling, and other purposes, in addition to domestic (employee) water use. Some industries, such as poultry processors, operate under strict U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines that require water use to maintain sanitary conditions within the facilities. Water need (i.e., the total water requirements of an industry, or the water withdrawals) is based on either production or employment, depending on the available information. 
Employment Projections 
The employment projections provided information on the anticipated employment growth rate for each industrial sector. The University of Georgia (UGA) produced the industry-specific rates of growth in employment for EPD, which were then used to calculate the future water needs for specific industries within the Suwannee-Satilla Region. General employment in heavy water-using industries such as food, textile (carpet), paper, fabricated metal products, chemicals, and electrical equipment sectors shows an upward trend throughout the 40 year planning period, while employment projections in the apparel, textile (fabric), and mining sectors decreased. In situations where there was a decrease in employment for major water using industries, the water use forecast was held constant over the planning horizon.  
September 2011  

4. Forecasting Future WaterResource Needs 
Industrial Water Forecasts 
Industrial water use was calculated based on available information including water need per unit of production, units of production per employee, and water need by employee. For industries where information was available on water use per unit of production, water forecasts were based on production. For industries where product based forecasting was not possible, industry-specific workforce projections were used to project the rate of future growth in water use within the industry. Industry employment data are readily available, and employment is linked to production, and thus indirectly linked to water requirements. By assuming that water use per production unit, and production per employee remain the same over the forecast period, future water needs can be estimated by future employment. Table 4-3 shows the baseline and alternate industrial water demands over the planning period.

Alternate Industrial  14.4  16.7  18.3  20.1  22.0  
Source: Suwannee-Satilla Water and Wastewater Technical Memorandum; CDM, 2011.  

In addition to the baseline industrial water demand forecast, the Suwannee-Satilla Council elected to develop an alternate forecast that includes an additional (above the baseline forecast) 5 MGD of industrial demand by 2050 (starting in 2020 and added incrementally every 10 years). While the Suwannee-Satilla Council could not identify the specific industries or locations, the general consensus was that the region is attractive to industry from a cost of operations and abundant water resources perspective. The Suwannee-Satilla Council recommended alternate industrial water and wastewater forecast is shown graphically in Figure 4-3. Industrial water demands in the Suwannee-Satilla Region are satisfied mainly through groundwater withdrawals, although some minor surface water withdrawals also occur. 
Industrial Wastewater Forecasts 
Industrial wastewater forecasts were calculated for each sector by multiplying the industrial water use by the ratio of wastewater to water for that industrial sector. For example in the apparel category, for every gallon of water used, there will be 0.6 gallons of wastewater produced. For the paper category, for every gallon of water used, there will be 1.0 gallon of wastewater produced. In some categories, this approach estimates that more wastewater will be produced than the gallons of water used. This occurs when wastewater treatment tanks and ponds are located outside the industrial facility and collect precipitation. This rainwater adds to the total wastewater effluent discharged or land-applied. Stone and gravel quarries also have to discharge rainwater that accumulates in the operational pits, and this flow adds to the permitted discharge. Thus, some industries have a wastewater to water use ratio greater than 1.0.

Once the industrial wastewater flows were estimated, the flows were separated between point discharges and land application. The industrial wastewater forecasts are presented in Figure 4-3 by the anticipated disposal system type: industrial wastewater treatment (point discharge), land application system, or discharge for municipal wastewater treatment.

4.3. Agricultural Forecasts 
The agricultural water use forecasts include irrigation demands for both crop and non-crop (including livestock, nurseries, and golf courses) uses.  The crop forecasts, developed by the University of Georgia for 2011 through 2050, provide a range of irrigation water use from dry to wet climate conditions based on the acres irrigated for each crop. Table 4-4 lists a drier-than-normal year crop irrigation forecast for each county. 
The University of Georgia also compiled non-crop (including non-permitted) agricultural water demand with the assistance of industry associations. Similar to crop irrigation, forecasts for nursery and greenhouse water use were also developed for a range of climate conditions over the planning period. For planning purposes, the drier-than-normal nurseries/greenhouse forecasts are presented in Table 4-4. For golf courses and livestock production, current (2011) water forecasts were developed, but future forecasts were not developed for this first round of regional water planning due to lack of available methodology. Current water demands were held constant throughout the planning period for these water use sectors. Full documentation of the methodology and results of the agricultural forecasts developed by the University of Georgia are available at:

Figure 4-4 shows the regional agricultural demands by source of supply. Agriculture is a very important economic driver in the Suwannee-Satilla Region. Throughout the planning period, forecasted agricultural water demand for the region is approximately 
2.5 to 3 times the combined municipal and industrial water demand. The Suwannee-Satilla Region as a whole is expected to see an increase of 16% in agricultural water demand by 2050. The largest increase in forecasted demand occurs in Echols County, with a 44% increase by 2050. Tift and Cook Counties have the next largest forecasted demand increases, at 29% and 24%, respectively. All other counties in the region are forecast to have increases of 20% or less through 2050. Charlton County has no forecasted increase in agricultural water demand through 2050. As shown in Figure 4-4, the majority of the agricultural withdrawals (close to 70%) are supplied by groundwater and the remainder by surface water.

4.4. Water for Thermoelectric Power Forecasts 
Thermoelectric water withdrawal and consumption demands were developed for the State of Georgia based on forecasted power generation needs and assumptions regarding future energy generation processes. There is no existing or currently planned thermoelectric power generated in the Suwannee-Satilla Region, so the associated water demand is zero for 2010 and 2020 as shown in Table 4-5. 
Beyond 2020, the location of generating facilities that may be built is not known. Therefore, water demands beyond 2020 associated with this unplanned power capacity need were developed on a state-wide basis and not disaggregated regionally. The state-wide forecasts show that in 2030, an additional 58 MGD of water consumption (106 MGD of withdrawal) is needed to meet projected state-wide energy production requirements, with 170 MGD of consumption (313 MGD of withdrawal) needed state-wide in 2050. 
The Suwannee-Satilla Council agrees that biomass is the most likely fuel source for energy production to be developed in the region in the future. The Council also agrees that the region has the water and biomass resources to support the future development of biomass energy production. However, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the direction of future national renewable energy policy that would play a role in shaping the development of energy production in the region. Therefore, rather than assigning a specific volume of the unassigned state-wide energy demand to the regional forecast, the Suwannee-Satilla Council has elected to qualitatively assess the potential for energy development in the region by continuing to monitor renewable energy policy.

4.5. Total Water Demand Forecasts 
Total water demand forecasts in 2010 and 2050 for the Suwannee-Satilla Region are summarized in Figure 4-5. This figure presents the forecasts for municipal, industrial (alternate forecast), and agricultural uses. Overall, the region is expected to grow by 24% (62 MGD) in water demand from 2010 through 2050. 
Total wastewater flow forecasts in 2010 and 2050 for the Suwannee-Satilla Region are summarized in Figure 4-6. This figure presents the forecasts for municipal and industrial flows. Overall, the region is expected to grow by 46% (27 MGD) in wastewater flows from 2010 through 2050.

Section 5. Comparison of Available Resource Capacity and Future Needs 
This Section compares the water and wastewater demand forecasts (Section 4), along with the Resource Assessments (Section 3), providing the basis for selecting water management practices (Sections 6 and 7). Areas where future demands exceed the capacity of the resource have a gap that will be addressed through water management practices. This Section summarizes the gaps and water supply needs for the Suwannee-Satilla Region. 





5.1. Groundwater Availability Comparisons 
Groundwater from the Upper Floridan Aquifer is a vital resource for the Suwannee-Satilla Region. Overall, the results from the Groundwater Availability Resource Assessment (EPD, March 2010) indicate that the sustainable yield for the modeled portions of the regional aquifer(s) is greater than the forecasted demands.  
At this time, no regional groundwater resource gaps are expected to occur in the Suwannee-Satilla Region over the 40 year planning horizon. However, depending on the pattern of groundwater development, local groundwater availability may not be able to meet all needs. In addition, some counties including Ben Hill, Brantley, Coffee, Cook, Echols, Lanier, Lowndes, Pierce, and Ware Counties may need additional permitted capacity if future demand for groundwater exceeds permitted groundwater withdrawal limits. The comparison of existing groundwater permitted capacity to forecasted future demand in the Suwannee-Satilla Region is shown in Table 5-1. Please note that sufficient capacity at the county level does not preclude localized municipal permit capacity shortages. Local water providers in counties with large demand forecasts should review their permitting needs.

5.2. Surface Water Availability Comparisons 
Surface water is an important resource used to meet current and future needs of the Suwannee-Satilla Region, especially in the agricultural sector. There are several surface water planning nodes located in and around the Suwannee-Satilla Region. The basic conclusions of the current and future conditions modeling are summarized below: 
. 	Atkinson (Satilla River) – surface water gaps under current and future conditions 
. 	Fargo (Suwannee River) – no significant surface water gaps under current and future conditions. The estimated shortfall is < 1 cfs and under current conditions is estimated to have a 3% duration and under future conditions a 1% duration 
. Jennings (Alapaha River) – surface water gaps under current and future conditions. . Pinetta (Withlacoochee River) – surface water gaps under current and future conditions. . Statenville (Alapaha River) – surface water gaps under current and future conditions

The term “gaps” is used to describe times when there is insufficient water to meet off-stream demands and also meet the targets for support of instream uses. When assessing this issue, the Suwannee-Satilla Council recognized that surface water gaps are driven by both net consumption (withdrawal minus returns) and year to year variations in river flows. In wet years, the region is likely to not experience any shortfalls to off-stream uses and instream needs. In dry years, the shortfalls are likely to be more severe. In order to better assess these shortfalls and to better understand the types of management practices that may be required, a more detailed quantification of the frequency and severity of shortage was completed.  
First, a quantification of the largest flow shortfall was completed. This quantification estimated the average flow of water that would be needed to increase stream flows to their minimum target levels, and it quantified the number of days that the flow would be needed. The flow needed and the number of days that it is needed results in an estimate of the total volume of water that would be needed to address the largest flow shortfall. 
Using the same approach outlined above, quantification of shortfalls was completed for the average flow needed to address 90% of the shortages and 50% of the shortages. It is important to note that in some cases the largest flow shortage did not always correspond to the largest volume shortage because some shortfalls are lower in flow rate, but longer in duration. 
The quantification of shortfalls is especially relevant when selecting water management practices. For example, if the preferred management practice is to replace surface water diversions with groundwater withdrawals, it is important to know how much flow needs to be generated and for what length of time. This process will in turn dictate the number and size of wells needed to generate the flow. If a reservoir is the preferred practice, then one needs to know the largest volume of storage needed because stream flow needs can then be addressed by controlling the rate of flow released from the reservoir. In addition, since the largest shortages occur less frequently, there are important cost-benefit considerations associated with addressing the largest and more infrequent shortfalls. 
The geographic location of the modeled regional surface water gaps are shown in Figure 5-1. The gaps are quantified in terms of flow.  The flow values depicted in the charts represent the average additional flow at that node that would be needed to close the specified gap occurrence. These flows are presented on a percent capture basis. The term “capture” refers to the percent of all gap occurrences at a node that are less than or equal to this flow value. For example, the 50% capture value indicates the flow that would be needed to close half the gap occurrences at a particular node, and the 100% capture value indicates the flow that would be needed to close all gap occurrences at a particular node. In addition to flow, values are given for gap duration (number of days the flow is below 7Q10) and volume (total volumetric shortfall to 7Q10 expressed in acre-feet) at each node. The years and months listed in the figure are tied to the hydrologic data set used in the modeling. The specific years and months are the periods of time when the referenced gap 
September 2011 

occurred. For example, at the Atkinson node the largest flow gap (100% capture) occurred between May and June 1941.  
The projected surface water use increases for the counties within the Suwannee- Satilla Region are shown in Table 5-2. Since there are current gaps at the referenced planning nodes, development of additional surface water to meet projected needs will need to be done in a manner that does not increase current gaps. Additional details are provided in the Suwannee-Satilla Gap Analysis Technical Memorandum (CDM, 2011).

5.3. Surface Water Quality Comparisons (Assimilative Capacity) 
This section summarizes the results of Resource Assessment modeling when all municipal and industrial wastewater treatment facilities operate at permit conditions, and provides a comparison of existing wastewater permitted capacity to the projected 2050 wastewater forecast flows.  A discussion on non-point source pollution is also included. 
Future Treatment Capacity Needs 
Existing municipal wastewater permitted capacities were compared to projected 2050 wastewater flows to estimate future treatment capacity needs by county.  This analysis was done for point sources and land application systems (LAS), which are both permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). As shown in Table 5-3, Bacon, Cook, Lowndes, and Pierce Counties may have infrastructure needs by 2050, although all were found to have planned projects to obtain sufficient treatment capacity underway through EPD’s permitting process. 
Assimilative Capacity Assessments 
The Assimilative Capacity Assessment (EPD, March 2011) at permit conditions was developed to estimate the ability of streams, estuaries, and harbors to assimilate pollutants under future conditions. The modeling was focused on dissolved oxygen (DO) and based on municipal and industrial wastewater facilities operating at their full permitted levels in terms of flow and effluent discharge limits. The results of the DO modeling are presented in Table 5-4 and Figure 5-2 for the Suwannee, Satilla, and St. Marys River basins. 
Figure 5-3 illustrates the number of reaches within each river basin in the region that have exceeded their DO assimilative capacity in either the baseline or permitted model runs or both. It is important to note that exceedance of assimilative capacity on a reach could be the result of a point source discharge, non-point source loading, modeling assumptions regarding the discharge, or a naturally low DO condition. The river basin tables in the figure summarize recommendations that arose out of coordination with EPD’s Watershed Protection Branch and the number of reaches within the basin for which these recommendations apply. In addition to improving low DO conditions in surface waters, these recommendations are aimed at providing sufficient future wastewater permit capacity and preparing for future nutrient standards in receiving waters.

Non-Point Source Pollution 
Non-point source pollution accounts for the majority of surface water impairments in the region according to the 2008 303(d) list of Rivers, Streams, Lakes, and Reservoirs published by EPD. Non-point source pollution can occur as a result of human activities, including urban development, agriculture, and silviculture, and as a result of non-human influences such as wildlife and naturally-occurring nutrients. An important component of any non-point source management program is identifying those pollutant sources that are resulting from human activities. 
Watershed nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) modeling was conducted for the Brunswick Harbor/Satilla River watersheds.  The goal was to identify nutrient loading rates from different portions of the watershed under various hydrologic conditions and evaluate them in relation to corresponding land uses and potential non-point source contributions. Results of watershed nutrient modeling identify portions of the watershed where there are higher concentration of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in stormwater runoff than other parts of the watershed. 
There are currently no nutrient standards in place for the Suwannee-Satilla Region, so there is no absolute threshold against which these nutrient loadings are compared. Rather, the nutrient model results are beneficial for relative comparisons to target areas where implementation of non-point source control management practices will have the greatest benefit. Nutrient and non-point source control management practices specific to land uses within the Suwannee-Satilla Region are discussed in Section 6. 



Section 6. Addressing Water Needs and Regional Goals 
This Section presents the Suwannee-Satilla Council’s water management practices selected to address resource shortfalls or gaps identified and described in Section 5, and/or meet the Council’s Vision and Goals described in Section 1. 



6.1. Identifying Water Management Practices 
The comparison of Resource Assessments and forecasted needs presented in Section 5 identifies the Region’s likely resource shortfalls or gaps and demonstrates the need for region and resource specific water management practices. In the cases where shortfalls or gaps appear to be unlikely based on the comparison of the Region’s Resource Assessments and forecasted needs, the management practices described in this section have been selected to also meet those needs specified by the Council (e.g., facility/infrastructure needs and practices, programmatic practices, etc.) that are aligned with the Region’s Vision and Goals. In selecting the actions needed (i.e., water management practices), the Council considered practices identified in existing plans, the Region’s Vision and Goals, and coordinated with local governments and water providers as well as neighboring Councils who share these water resources. 

Review of Existing Plans and Practices 
The Council conducted a comprehensive review of existing local and regional water management plans and relevant related documents to frame the selection of management practices.  The types of plans/studies that were reviewed to support identification and selection of management practices for the Suwannee-Satilla Region consisted of the following: 
. 	Comprehensive Work Plans (local and regional scale) 
. 	Regional infrastructure and permitting plans 
. 	EPD databases (permitted withdrawals, planned projects, and proposed reservoirs) 
September 2011  

SUWANNEE-SATILLA 

. 	State-wide guidance documents (conservation, cost, and water planning) 
. 	Best Management Practices (forestry, agriculture, and stormwater 
management) 

. 	Water quality studies including Watershed Protection Plans (basin, 
watershed, and local scale) 

.	 TMDL evaluations 
When possible, successful management practices already planned for and/or in use in the Suwannee-Satilla Region formed the basis for the water management practices selected by the Council.  
6.2. Selected Water Management Practices for the Suwannee-Satilla Region 
Table 6-1 summarizes the Suwannee-Satilla Council’s selected management practices by source of supply for the relevant demand sector(s), including surface water supply for agricultural irrigation, permitted municipal and industrial water and wastewater capacity, water quality assimilative capacity (dissolved oxygen) challenges, current water quality impairments, and nutrient considerations for the Satilla River watershed.  Information on shared resources is provided to identify where management practices in other regional Councils are also needed to address identified gaps.  The table summarizes general information regarding management practices needed to meet forecasted needs, and more detailed information on management practices needed to address gaps between available resources and forecasted needs. The Suwannee-Satilla Council reviewed a number of existing local and regional water management plans and related documents during the development and selection of management practices. A detailed list of plans and documents that were considered can be found in the Suwannee-Satilla Plans Reviewed in Selecting Water Management Practices Technical Memorandum (CDM, 2011). 
The most significant gaps in the Suwannee-Satilla Region are surface water availability gaps driven by agricultural irrigation usage (in the table the term 7Q10 refers to the 1 in 10 year 7 day low flow condition). As such, the majority of water supply management practices in Table 6-1 are intended to address agricultural surface water use. The Suwannee-Satilla Council considered a number of practices to address these surface water availability gaps, ranging from agricultural conservation to one or more regional reservoirs. While reservoirs would provide multiple potential benefits, the flat topography of the region makes siting of regional reservoirs difficult, expensive, and may have associated impacts. The Council concluded that integrating practices, rather than using a single practice would be more effective at addressing gaps and more economically feasible. Figure 6-1 illustrates the Suwannee-Satilla Council’s recommended suite of surface water availability management practices in a phased approach. Those practices that are 
September 2011 

less costly and more readily implemented are prioritized for short-term implementation. If resource needs are not met and/or gaps are not addressed, then more costly and complex management practices will be pursued. 
Surface water gaps (increased frequency or severity of 7Q10 low flow conditions) in the region exist at times under current and future conditions at the Atkinson, Jennings, Pinetta, and Statenville will be addressed by management practices including those that reduce net consumption, replace surface water use with groundwater use, improve data on frequency and magnitude of gaps, and assessing the impact of infrequent surface water gaps and the associated costs associated with these gaps, among others.  These gaps occur primarily as a result of net consumption associated with agricultural water use in the May–July timeframe. As described in Section 5.2, it is important to keep in mind that shortage to low flow conditions do not occur every year and in some cases for years with shortages the shortages do not occur for the entire year. 
Figure 6-2 illustrates the Suwannee-Satilla Council’s recommended suite of surface water quality management practices in a phased approach. Table 6-1 also includes the Suwannee-Satilla Council’s recommended management practices to address water quality gaps, including stream segments with limited localized dissolved oxygen assimilative capacity and insufficient wastewater permit capacity. The Suwannee-Satilla Council addresses gaps by: identifying and recommending specific actions to add/improve infrastructure and improve flow and water quality conditions. Management practices that help improve river flows may also help improve water quality. 
In addition to addressing gaps, the Suwannee-Satilla Council identified several management practice recommendations in Table 6-1 to address forecast future uses. These recommendations include such practices as the additional sustainable development of groundwater and surface water in areas with sufficient water supply; best management practices for water quality issues such as non-point source runoff, nutrient loadings, and TMDLs in the region; and additional educational and ordinance practices. The selected management practices will over time address identified gaps and meet future uses when combined with practices for all shared resource regions.

Summary of Management Practices for Shared Resources – The Suwannee-Satilla Region will implement management practices summarized in this table and collaborate with the following Councils to address shared resource gaps.  Note:  As summarized below, each Council has identified a series of management practices intended to address the contributing portion of the surface water flow gap within their boundaries.  
Surface Water Quantity – Satilla River (Atkinson), Alapaha River (Statenville and Jennings), and Withlacoochee River (Pinetta) Suwannee-Satilla – The Suwannee-Satilla Council has identified the management practices in the above table to address the majority of the cumulative gap at Atkinson, Statenville, and Jennings, and a portion of the cumulative gap at Pinetta. Altamaha – The Altamaha Council has identified water conservation, replacement of surface water use with groundwater use, refinement of forecasting and modeling data, and potential use of incentives and new permit conditions among others to address a portion of the cumulative gap at Atkinson, and a small portion of the cumulative gaps at Statenville and Jennings. Lower Flint-Ochlockonee – The Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Council has identified conservation, investigation of replacement of surface water with groundwater, greater utilization of farm ponds, and consideration of new storage and Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) to address a portion of the cumulative gap at Pinetta. Upper Flint – The Upper Flint Council has identified conservation, investigation of replacement of surface water with groundwater, greater utilization of farm ponds, and consideration of new storage and ASR to address a portion of the cumulative gap at Statenville and Jennings. Surface Water Quality: Satilla River Watershed Model – The Altamaha Council has identified the same BMPs for nutrient loading as are summarized in the above table for the Suwannee-Satilla Council. Altamaha – There is one reach with exceeded assimilative capacity in the Suwannee River basin that is shared with the Altamaha Region. The Altamaha Council recommends improved level of wastewater treatment to improve in-stream dissolved oxygen, implementation of ammonia limits, and improvement of wastewater treatment for nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus). Coastal Georgia – There is one reach with exceeded DO assimilative capacity in the St. Marys River basin that is shared with the Coastal Georgia Region. Both Councils recommend monitoring and data collection to assess whether impairment is caused by non-point source discharges or naturally low DO concentrations in the reach.

Section 7. Implementing Water Management Practices 

This section presents the Suwannee-Satilla Council’s estimated timeframes for the implementation of the water management practices identified in Section 6. Schedules for implementation, in addition to the early step(s) required to initiate implementation of a given practice, are presented for both short- and long-term actions. The Suwannee-Satilla Council has defined short-term as 2010 to 2020 and long-term as 2020 to 2050. As the State Water Plan provides, this Plan will be primarily implemented by the various water users in the region; therefore, the Suwannee-Satilla Council has described the roles and responsibilities of the implementing parties as well as the fiscal implications of the practices. 
The Council also emphasizes that the implementation of recommended management practices are predicated on a number of planning assumptions and/or may be impacted by unanticipated or currently unknown factors including: projected growth of population, industry, agricultural and energy needs; data sets and assumptions related to water use, water withdrawals and returns; data regarding water quality and watershed models; rules and regulations regarding water resource use and management; and Resource Assessment tools 

for surface water availability, surface water quality, and groundwater availability. Consequently, significant changes or departures from these planning assumptions, forecasts, and Resource Assessment tools may require a modification of the recommended management practices, the implementation schedule, and/or the implementing entities/affected stakeholders. Future planning efforts should confirm current assumptions and make necessary revisions and/or improvements to the conclusions reached during this round of planning.   


7.1. Implementation Schedule and Roles of Responsible Parties 
Table 7-1 ties the resource shortfalls and the needs specified by the Council and the corresponding management practices detailed in Table 6-1 to the parties who will implement those practices. This table also describes the timeframe for implementation and the specific steps required for implementation.

7. Implementing Water Management  Practices 
7.2. Fiscal Implications of Selected Water Management Practices 
The following subsections discuss planning level cost estimates for the water management practices selected by the Suwannee-Satilla Council and potential funding sources and options.  Successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan is highly dependent on the ability of state and local governments, water providers, and utilities to fund the needed implementation actions. 
Planning Level Cost Estimates 
Planning level cost estimates were prepared for each management practice as shown in Table 7-2 using planning guidance documents, the knowledge base of previous state and utility planning efforts, and other sources of information, as listed below: 
. 	Georgia EPD Supplemental Guidance for Planning Contractors: Water 
Management Practice Cost Comparison dated March 2010 (Revised March 
2011). 

. 	Water Conservation Analysis Technical Memorandum to Supplement Council’s Plan prepared by CDM for Georgia EPD draft dated July 2011.  
. 	CDM Water Supply Cost Estimation Study prepared for the South Florida 
Water Management District dated February 2007. 

. 	EPA Report titled Costs of Urban Stormwater Control Practices – Preliminary Report dated February 5, 2006. 
. 	EPA Report titled Costs of Urban Stormwater Control dated January 2002. 
. 	St. Johns River Water Management District Report titled Water Supply Needs and Sources Assessment Alternative Water Supply Strategies Investigation, Water Supply and Wastewater Systems Component Cost Information dated 1997 (Publication Number SJ97-SP3). 
. 	Preliminary estimates of production well yields and costs from local licensed well drillers in Georgia (Bishop Well and Pump Service and Grosch Irrigation Company.)  
. 	Georgia Geologic Survey Project Report 32 titled Irrigation Conservation 
Practices Appropriate for the Southeastern United States. Prepared in 
cooperation with the Georgia DNR, EPD. 

. 	Groundwater Flow Modeling of the Coastal Plain Aquifer System of Georgia.  Draft Report completed for EPD as part of State of Georgia Groundwater Resource Assessment. 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
SUWANNEE-SATILLA 

. 	FY 2004 Sussex Conservation District Cover Crop Program Fact Sheet. 
Sussex Conservation District, Georgetown, Delaware dated 2003. 

. 	North Carolina State University Department of Forestry presentation titled Costs of Forestry Best Management Practices in the South: A Review dated 2002. 
. 	Recent bid tabulations for wastewater treatment facilities. 
The cost estimates are unit cost estimates where there is a lack of detail or specificity about the management practice. For example, for an inter-basin transfer of water, the cost is driven by the length and size of the pipeline and the quantity to be transferred. If the connection locations and or the transfer quantity are not known, a unit cost per mile of pipeline is given.  Where there is detail about the management practice, unit cost data were used to develop an approximate capital/programmatic cost.  The capital costs were adjusted to 2010 dollars using the Engineering News Record Cost Index. In summary, some cost estimates are unit costs with different unit basis and some costs are approximate capital costs. Therefore, each management practice was assigned a cost (where applicable) rather than rolling up the costs into general categories since they may not be additive.  The cost information provided in this document will be used to pursue loans, grants, and other funding options that can be prioritized throughout the region. 
Funding Sources and Options 
Several different funding sources and options will be used to secure funding for the different management practices outlined in this Plan including: 
. 	The State Revolving Fund Program 
. 	Other State of Georgia Funding Programs 
. 	State and Federal Grants 
. 	Water/Wastewater System Revenues  
. 	State and local government incentive programs 
More details on potential loan and grant programs are provided for the management practices in Table 7-2. Below is a list of some of the larger organizations and agencies that provide funding for the types of management practices recommended in this Plan.  It is important to note that funding sources and opportunities change on a yearly basis. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Programs 
The EPA provides grants to States, non-profits, and educational institutions to support high-quality research that will improve the scientific basis for decisions on

7.3. Alignment with Other Plans 
The Suwannee-Satilla Council’s Plan and management practices selection process was based on identifying and supporting existing policy, planning, and projects. Local comprehensive plans, planned and/or permitted projects were relied upon in developing the Regional Water Plan. This approach is tailored to maintain consistency with, and to maximize support for, locally driven water resource management decisions. The Suwannee-Satilla Council did identify potential challenges associated with both the cost and technical issues that the region may face; especially regarding water and wastewater needs for both new and aging infrastructure.  In addition, addressing existing surface water gaps must be accomplished in a manner that does not cause adverse impacts to local water users and local governments. 
SUWANNEE-SATILLA 


7. Implementing Water Management  Practices 
The challenges of funding Plan recommendations and addressing future technical and regulatory issues is especially difficult for smaller towns and utilities, agricultural water uses, and small businesses that rely on natural resources. The successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan will be dependent on the principles of support and leadership by state agencies, in a collaborative setting, utilizing incentives and financial assistance to the extent possible. 
7.4. Recommendations to the State 
The Suwannee-Satilla Council supports the concept of regional water resource planning with a focus on planning Councils composed of local governments, water users, water providers, industry, business, and affected stakeholders. Local representatives are typically most familiar with local water resource issues and needs. The State has a vital role providing technical support, guidance, and funding to support locally focused water resource planning. This Plan should be viewed as a living, iterative document and the State should focus on the following principles: 
Education, Incentives, Collaboration, Cooperation, Enabling, Supporting 
The Suwannee-Satilla Council is sensitive to unintended consequences if Plan recommendations become mandates or infringe upon private property rights. The State must help balance Plan recommendations with assessing measurable progress toward Plan implementation. If additional rules or other administrative or regulatory actions are deemed necessary, the State should work with Councils to help ensure workable solutions. 
The following specific recommendations to the State are provided to help aid in the successful implementation of the Plan.  
Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) 
. 	Consider “institutionalizing” planning. This would entail a long term commitment of staff and funding to: monitor and support Plan recommendations; coordinate improved data collection, management and analysis; continue to develop and improve Resource Assessment tools; and help provide funding, permitting, and technical support to address gaps and water resource needs. 
. 	Work with Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission, Georgia Department of Agriculture, University of Georgia and other relevant institutions to improve agricultural water use data collection and management. This effort would focus on refining source(s) of supply for multiple irrigation sources, continuing to assess data on crop water requirements, evaluating the effects of farm ponds on direct irrigation withdrawals and the hydrologic cycle, and further research on crop consumptive use. This data in turn should be coordinated with Resource Assessment tools to ensure accurate simulation of any gaps and assumptions. 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
. 	Work with the Southern Georgia Regional Commission to expand water quality monitoring of tributaries on the State’s 303(d) list and tributaries identified as having little or no dissolved oxygen assimilative capacity. Develop a new dissolved oxygen standard that reflects the naturally low concentrations in blackwater streams that are prevalent in this area. 
. 	Focus funding support and permitting assistance to projects and programs aimed at addressing gap areas. Where possible, leverage federal funds to help support and expedite project implementation. 
. 	Consider collaborative approaches to collecting more standardized water use data and improving data on water demands. This would include continued improvement and updating databases used in the planning process. It would also involve working with the Georgia Municipal Association, Georgia Association of County Commissioners, and other relevant stakeholders to improve water use information. 
. 	Working with Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, examine opportunities to improve coordination among water providers and users and create incentives to maximize existing infrastructure and coordinated operations. 
. 	Continue to engage in dialogue and data-sharing with the States of Florida and South Carolina regarding current and forecasted groundwater use. South Georgia, North Florida, and South Carolina rely on the Upper Floridan Aquifer to meet water supply needs and it is in EPD’s best interest to include the most accurate available information on growth and groundwater use in both states in the Resource Assessment modeling. 
Georgia Environmental Finance Authority (GEFA) 
. 	Meeting forecasted water supply needs will require stable and flexible funding sources to assist water users and water and wastewater utilities in meeting forecasted needs. A stable GEFA financing source(s) should be provided for necessary water supply, water and wastewater plant construction, and plant upgrades to address current and future gaps. 
Georgia Forestry Commission (GFC) 
. 	Continue to support and fund the GFC Forestry Best Management Practices Program. Providing education and incentives to control erosion and segmentation will help the region prevent/address TMDL listed segments, reduce nutrient loadings, and support wetland areas. This will have the benefit of helping sustaining baseflow conditions of streams and water quality. 
SUWANNEE-SATILLA 


Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission (GSWCC) 
GSWCC should continue to provide leadership and locally focused efforts in the following programs: 
. 	Continue education and outreach associated with Urban Erosion and Sediment Control program including certification of individuals involved in land disturbing activities and on-site implementation of erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control plans. This will help address the water quality needs of the region. 
. 	Continue education and outreach efforts to agricultural interests through annual Irrigation Meetings and other avenues to inform farmers of available technologies and funding sources to make more efficient use of water resources without incurring hardship. 
. 	Support completion, maintenance and improvement of the Agricultural Water Use Measurement Program, which is aimed at cost effectively collecting agricultural water use data across the state, and integrating cooperative arrangements with the private sector and partnerships with other State agencies. This program is a vital component to helping the State and regions effectively manage and utilize water resources. 
. 	Support Georgia Agricultural Conservation Incentive program, which provides funding support to help implement conservation practices. Funding for this program is essential to help implement conservation measures, especially in the regional watersheds where there are surface water gaps. 
. 	Provide incentives to restore wetlands and historically drained hardwood swamps and other natural retention areas. Restoration of these features will replenish sources of headwaters by retaining surface runoff and releasing it over a longer period to offset loss of baseflows between rain events, while also providing additional recharge to surficial aquifers. 
Office of State Planning and Budget (OPB) 
. 	Obtain population census data and compare to population forecasts to track trends in the accuracy of population projections. 
. 	Revise population forecasts and support ongoing state-wide planning. 
Department of Community Affairs (DCA) 
. 	Identify and encourage local governments to integrate Regional Water Plan management practices with land use and water quality/quantity nexuses into their comprehensive planning efforts.  
. 	Continue to promote coordinated environmental planning. 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
In-State Universities and Colleges 
. 	Research the percent loss and consumption of irrigation water applied to crops to estimate how much of the water that is applied to a crop is lost to evaporation, runs off into surface waters, and infiltrates to groundwater. 
. 	Research varieties of crops that require less water and are more drought resistant. 
. 	Research the impacts of development and various land uses on aquifer recharge areas. 
. 	Research the effectiveness of management practices to control non-point source pollutants such as sediment, fecal coliform, and nutrients in stormwater runoff from different land uses including urban and rural development, agriculture, and silviculture. 
. 	Research the role played by wetlands in abating runoff flows from storm events, providing source water for surface water features, and treating surface water quality. Evaluate the benefits of restoring previously drained and/or developed wetlands to their natural state. 
Georgia Department of Agriculture (DOA) 
. 	Provide technical information and participate in needed studies to better characterize agricultural water uses and quantification of shortages to low flow conditions. 
. 	Assist with outreach and education of agricultural users to obtain greater understanding of surface water resource limitations, both quality and quantity, and to help improve the implementation rate of management practices. Assist EPD and other state agencies in coordinating accomplishment of the above goals with the Georgia Farm Bureau. 
Georgia Department of Natural Resources [Coastal Resources Division (CRD) and Wildlife Resources Division (WRD)] 
. 	Continue to monitor resources and help sustain, enhance, protect and conserve Georgia’s natural, historic, and cultural resources. 
. 	Provide technical and ecosystem information to help support state water planning needs.

Section 8. Monitoring and Reporting Progress 
The selected water management practices identified in Section 6 will be primarily implemented (as described in Section 7) by the various water users in the Region, including local governments and others with the capacity to develop water infrastructure and apply for the required permits, grants, and loans. 




8.1. Benchmarks 
The benchmarks prepared by the Suwannee-Satilla Council and listed in Table 8-1 below will be used to assess the effectiveness of this Plan’s implementation and identify any required revisions.  As detailed below, the Suwannee-Satilla Council selected both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks that will be used to assess whether the water management practices are closing gaps over time and allowing the water planning region to meet its Vision and Goals.  The benchmarks will be used to evaluate the Regional Water Plan effectiveness at the next 5-year Plan review. 
Effective implementation of the Plan will require the availability of sufficient funding in the form of loans, and in some cases, possibly grants. In addition, many of the proposed management practices require ongoing coordination with affected stakeholders/water users and collaboration to help ensure successful solutions are identified and implemented. Finally, in many cases monitoring progress toward addressing future needs will require improved data and information on the current actions and management practices that are already in place. The benchmarks will be used to evaluate the Regional Water Plan effectiveness at the next 5-year Plan review and will require collection of information in the intervening years to better quantify and document resource conditions and progress toward meeting regional needs and goals. The successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan will require both leadership and supporting roles by Georgia EPD, other state agencies, local government and water and wastewater utilities, as well as individual water users.

8.2. Plan Updates 
Meeting current and future water needs will require periodic review and revision of Regional Water Plans. The State Water Plan and associated rules provide that each Regional Water Plan will be subject to review by the appropriate Regional Water Planning Council every five years and in accordance with the guidance provided by the Director, unless otherwise required by the Director for earlier review. These reviews and updates will allow an opportunity to adapt the Regional Water Plan based on changed circumstances and new information arising in the five years after EPD’s adoption of these plans. These benchmarks will guide EPD in the review of the Regional Water Plan.   
The Councils appointed to prepare future Regional Water Plan updates will have the opportunity to review the recommendations of past Plans against current available data to make a determination as to which management practices are still appropriate and which ones need to be revised or augmented to meet changing conditions. Future Councils will also have the ability to judge the effectiveness of practices recommended in previous Plans against available benchmark data. This analysis will reveal which practices are effective and what adjustments are necessary to compensate for less effective practices.  
8.3. Plan Amendments 
The Suwannee-Satilla Council emphasizes that the recommendations in this Regional Water Plan are based on the best information available at the time the Plan was written. New information and issues that may impact the recommendations should be considered and incorporated into relevant implementation decisions and future Regional Water Plan updates. Future planning efforts should confirm current assumptions and make necessary revisions and/or improvements to the conclusions reached during this phase of planning.
